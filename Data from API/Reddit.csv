Work is a necessary part of life. More than simply a means to a paycheck, work gives individuals a sense of dignity and accomplishment. Feeling as though one is participating in meaningful work, whether it is contributing to a massive project or an individual artistic pursuit, allows one to feel as though they have a purpose.

While this urge to create or work appears to be a universal human trait, the conditions in which individuals work are constantly changing. This is particularly the case during or following major technological “revolutions.” Neolithic revolutions throughout the world transformed hunter and gatherer societies into sedentary farming communities. Meanwhile, the Industrial Revolution that began in Europe during the eighteenth century saw the rise of steam power, the precursors to modern factories, and technologies that led to the widespread decline of cottage industries, guilds, and artisanal labor in general.

This was just the first of many such revolutions. It was followed by the Second Industrial Revolution of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, which saw the introduction of electricity, the modern assembly line, and the use of interchangeable parts — particularly in North America and Europe. The Third Industrial Revolution, which began in the middle of the twentieth century, was characterized by the rise of digitalization, computing, information technologies, and the globalization of supply chains. The latter process has led to the deindustrialization of many regions within the Global North (such as the Rust Belt in the Great Lakes region) and the accelerated industrialization of parts of the Global South, especially provincial cities in the Far East, which have become magnets for previously rural migrant workers ([nongmingong](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2019/05/china-migrant-workers-miserable/589423/) or min-gong) who have been displaced by industrialized and automated farming systems.

Some (most notably [Klaus Schwab](https://www.weforum.org/about/the-fourth-industrial-revolution-by-klaus-schwab)) now posit that we are entering into a Fourth Industrial Revolution, which will be characterized by rapid technological developments in the fields of artificial intelligence, digital networking, quantum computing, robotics, materials science, and genetics, and that these advances will once again radically change society. Some of these changes will undoubtably be good. Novel medicines will likely be developed that can prevent or cure a host of diseases. Advances in renewable energy technology, building science, and other fields may ensure humanity averts a climate disaster. The growth of decentralized distribution networks could allow us to eliminate a great deal of food waste. The list goes on.

While all these changes have the capacity to eliminate suffering and to use resources more efficiently, the same technology has the potential to fundamentally alter the concept of the “job” by making work scarcer and more precarious for all but a privileged minority.

**The Rise of the Precariat**

All technological revolutions have made certain jobs, skills, and previous technologies obsolete. This is known as technological unemployment. For workers who are affected by these changes, they can either fight against the process or look for opportunity elsewhere. (Those in the former group are often called [Luddites](https://www.historic-uk.com/HistoryUK/HistoryofBritain/The-Luddites/), a term which refers to a group of highly skilled textile workers in eighteenth-century England who destroyed the mechanical looms and weavers that threatened their livelihood.) The fight against change, however, is not easy, as new technologies make products cheaper to produce and cheaper to purchase. This leaves them at odds not only with owners, but consumers, too. As adoption becomes more widespread, the fight becomes increasingly quixotic.

This phenomenon is not rare, nor is it a relic of the past. If anything, it is becoming more common as computers have become smaller and more powerful (see [Moore’s Law](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/02/24/905789/were-not-prepared-for-the-end-of-moores-law/)), and the rate at which broader technological advances occur has accelerated (see [Kurzweil’s Law](https://www.businessinsider.com/ray-kurzweil-law-of-accelerating-returns-2015-5)). For futurists and tech CEOs, this kind of disruption is considered good because it allows for more innovative solutions to problems and to replace existing markets. For [less educated and older workers](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32378944/), it can mean the effective disappearance of their professions.

This has already happened to many manual workers who lack specialized training or experience. Millions have been displaced by globalization or automation that has occurred in the last fifty years — in regions like the Rust Belt, for example — and they have been forced to take refuge in the service economy or, more recently, by participating in what is known as the gig economy. Many theorists have taken to calling this new group the [precariat](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/11/precariat-global-class-rise-of-populism/) (a portmanteau combining the words “precarious” and “proletariat”) because these jobs are oftentimes tentative or part-time.

If the Fourth Industrial Revolution follows this trend of accelerating the process of displacement, these industries that have served as a refuge for the precariat will also see increased automation via AI and robotics, which will mean even fewer jobs. Combined with the rise in the number of people entering the workforce due to population growth, automation threatens to make it impossible to provide employment to everyone who wants a job.

While technological advances have historically impacted workers who work primarily with their hands or do not require a great deal of specialized knowledge to enter into their industry, new technologies may affect even highly skilled and specialized workers whose work is solely intellectual. Even certain healthcare professionals, like [therapists](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/07/world-without-work/395294/), may share a similar fate due to advances in AI. If a therapy “bot” can offer services that are indistinguishable from a human therapist at a fraction of the cost and without the need to travel to an office or schedule an appointment, how long can this remain a viable profession for thousands of people?

This begs the very blunt question: If these new technologies eliminate the need for tens of millions of jobs and there is no new industry to serve as a refuge, what is everyone going to do?

**The Impact on Mental Health**

While this is no doubt a fecund discussion, as this process will demand a restructuring and rethinking of how current economic, management, and political systems are organized, these potential changes present dozens of significant problems from the perspective of public health, especially mental health.

Many of them have already materialized.

I will focus only on two for now, as they both stem from the high likelihood that traditional employment will continue to be thought of as a necessary part of adulthood, even if traditional jobs may not be available to all adults.

As work becomes scarcer, competition for available positions will become more aggressive. Those who manage to keep their positions may increasingly seek to prove themselves to be indispensable to their superiors, which could lead to an acceleration of the existing culture of instant accessibility wherein workers are always available via email or phone — even if compensation is still modeled on a 40-hour workweek. In an organization with leadership willing to exploit this vulnerability, they could tacitly demand workers perform duties beyond their contractual tasks, a phenomenon that has been described as [compulsory citizenship behavior](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31349722/).

Even today, there is already worry that the erosion of the distinction between work and leisure times due to social media, work emails, and other duties is leaving individuals in near perpetual state of stress that can have a wide array of negative health outcomes. The proverbial “giving 110%” here takes on a sinister meaning, as it implies that one is expected to give more than what is possible to their job and that anything less is a shortcoming that is grounds for their termination. Apart from being an oppressive practice that seems ethically dubious, evidence suggests that such a demanding environment negatively impacts worker engagement and performance, and that [organization-wide productivity](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5129275/) may suffer as a consequence if such attitudes are made endemic due to toxic leadership.

Conversely, many may experience another form of[ anxiety](https://www.ft.com/content/e61ca2e2-18f0-11e5-a130-2e7db721f996) should they continue to find it difficult to find steady work. Worse, some may fall into despair if they lack certain resources or abilities. Even if there is the implementation of a universal basic income to prevent the worst aspects of long-term unemployment or underemployment, there will likely be continued expectations and social pressure to have a job. Those who cannot meet those expectations will likely feel deeply humiliated, lonely, and resentful, and will likely experience many of the [well-documented](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5129275/) physical and mental health problems associated with “[worklessness](https://thischangedmypractice.com/the-risks-of-worklessness/)” (hypertension, diabetes, stroke, heart attack, anxiety, and depression).

**The Role of Mental Health Professionals**

Such a paradigm shift has already begun and will likely accelerate during and following the coronavirus-related recession. One can be hopeful that these are temporary problems that will eventually be resolved by intensive reforms and changes in policy, but they are clear and present challenges that will not go away on their own for the foreseeable future. We need to acknowledge that these changes are happening and that the resultant stressors are having an impact on people from virtually all walks of life.

For those of us who work as mental health professionals, we will have to become more attuned to these global phenomena to better understand our patients and their struggles. We will need to better empathize with the anxieties of those who feel as though they are only as secure as the caprices of their employers, as well as the anger of those who feel as though they have been cast by the wayside or lack a purpose. We must recognize the material circumstances that are shaping our patients’ conditions if we are to properly treat them."

Parenting,technology,10h07ws,She’s proud of me.,"We found out my wife was pregnant in 2019 and it changed everything. 
I was a guy who worked full time and sold pot on the side to help with bills. 
I decided I needed to change for my family. 
Long story short, I got a second job and started going to school. My daughter was born in 2020 and it was the best moment of my life. While still in school we found out we were having a boy in 2022. Two kids in two years. By that time our lives had completely changed. 
I graduated in December with a degree in Mechanical Design Technology and landed a job as an Engineer. 

My diploma came in the mail yesterday. I opened it and my daughter(2 year old) said “daddy let me see.” I showed her and she said “whoaaa” and it was cute. 
Then she said “I’m proud of you daddy.” 
I melted. Tears instantly. All the 80 hour work weeks. The nights of getting off from my second job, holding a sleeping baby in one arm while doing homework with the other. Everything was worth it because of that one little sentence that I’m not even sure my two year old completely understands yet. One of the best feelings ever."

They had a lot of kids, less technology, etc. Did they sleep train? Did they just not sleep? Was it easier because there were less rules. I’ve always wondered how prior generations parented. We have one who’s sleepntrained and some days I feel I barely have my head above water!!!"
Parenting,technology,107knm7,I’m 33 and Don’t have kids. I just adopted a 14 year old,"Odd situation but my wife and I have been together for 10 years. My wife has a little brother who is 14 now. He lives in Colorado and we live in Georgia now. I’m essentially a washed up software engineer and now I own a salon. People think my wife and I have our life together but we don’t. 

I’ve known him since he was 5 years old and apparently I’m the only real male/father figure in his life. Never realized the impact I’ve had on him with the little bit of time I ever get with him. Well this past thanksgiving break he staid with us and we joked about him moving in with us since every time he stays with us he learns so much. 

Within 2 weeks his mother gave up custody and now he is living with us and he just started school last week for the first time. 

He went from an awful school system, living alone because his mom was never around to now living with us and attending one of the top academy in the state of Georgia. It was my old high school, I use to be honor student, 3 sport athlete, D1 soccer and had a mom who worked all the time so I achieved a lot of it on my own. So I expected kinda the same from him.

I’m starting to realize that he is very behind, his idea of doing good is making a C+, he games all day which is partially my fault because I taught him how to build a PC at a young age and I use to be in esports. I just figured I’d get him into tech because when I was 13 I was building websites, putting on events, self taught coder etc. turns out he just games and can barely work technology. Not very outgoing, socially awkward. Just imagine a kid who sits at home all day with no parents and games all day. Zero critical thinking skills and I swear he can be in a house full of food and will starve to death. He use to live off Oreos and milk

I understand I have to take it slow but I just don’t know where to start he is an amazing kid, learns quickly but theirs just so much to teach. Also not sure if it’s just him or kids but theirs no respect for a craft. I’ll teach him the basics of something and he think he knows it all already. I’m just so lost and don’t know where to start. It’s been years since I’ve been in school or had to be a responsible human being and here I am with a 14 year old.

Let’s start small, movies/tv shows to watch to help engage and teach life skills.

Any board games or fun projects ideas to do play to engage teamwork and critical thinking skills?

How do you even be a parent? When I was young I was in sports and that made me who I am today. Responsibility, accountability, communications, teamwork, mentorship etc. I’m not going to throw him in sports until next year because he is just so behind still.

Right now I’m just focusing on being there for him and supporting him. He trusts me because I’ll never scold him and I just want to know more details so we can both together overcome this. He is learning that all he just needs to do is ask. I know eventually down the road we need to focus the shift to academics and I just want a head start before things are starting to be expected out of him"
Parenting,technology,wn45pw,4 yr old. Outside and technology,"I have a 4 year old (as the title states).  To give a short background, my wife got a tablet for our son because they were planning on a long plane ride.  I was against it but ultimately said ok.  We did have the conversation about limiting time and not making it a daily thing.  I work evenings a few days a week and she will make supper so he gets to be in it I guess.  It's at a point where after he gets home from preschool he immediately asks for the tablet.  I try to play with him, toys, going outside when it's not 90+ degrees out/to the park, coming with me somewhere and he says no because he would rather play on the tablet.  

I get technology is going to be used, but I don't like that it is such a big thing now (he gets 30 min a day) and then my wife introduced him to the wii so they will play something on Wii sports almost every night before winding down.  Maybe I'm over reacting but I don't like what I'm seeing as a trend.

I have talked to my wife and she suggested using it as a reward but no idea what he would do.  Then she said he has to play outside before playing on it which I don't agree with either.   I guess I'm not sure at this point what I'm asking or whatever.  Just kind of frustrated and disappointed and not sure if I'm just not looking at this correctly."
Parenting,technology,10pxhpf,10 yr old son refusing to do school work,"Hi there, I'm hoping to get some advice because we've tried everything. 
My son is 10 years old and currently in a grade 4 class, he is technically in grade 5 but he is currently learning at a 2-3 grade level so he is the only ""grade 5"" in the class. He is in a special placement class in order to catch up and get extra assistance. He is diagnosed with ADHD and ODD, and we are also in therapy. 

Long story short, he has always struggled with school, we had trouble getting him diagnosed so he went without support until grade 2. We have tried tons of consequences, in school and at home, reward systems, scribes, using technology to do work, he has a counselor at school and a therapist outside of school, plus the special placement class where there are only 8 other children and a specially trained teacher. He refuses to do work, he says it's boring and he hates it and ""would rather kill himself than do school work."" He wants to be a YouTuber when he grows up but when I explain he needs to do his school work to find a job or he won't be able to support himself until he's able to make a living off of that, he says he'll just die instead then. 

I am at a loss for what to do, he was moved to this program because his home school couldn't handle his behaviour issues as he gets overwhelmed in large crowds and acts out aggressively. Now he can still be quite mean to the other students and throws chairs (not at people) when he doesn't get picked for something, but it has definitely improved being in a smaller classroom. If we can't come up with a way to get him to do school work he'll lose his placement spot. 

Has anyone else dealt with something like this? Has anything worked? I'm a single mom currently in school and working part time in order to afford his therapy. All of my time is spent reading books and researching different methods trying to find something that might work. We know it's a self esteem issue and we know it's because he struggled without an IEP at the start, we just don't know what to do to motivate him."
Parenting,technology,thi268,I am terrified of technology,"My kids aren’t even at the age where I have to really worry about technology, but I am terrified of the prospect of the amount of stuff they will easily have access to once they reach grade school. 

Pornography, YouTube (and it’s horrible algorithm), TikTok, Instagram, even Reddit are just full of trash content, terrible messaging, extremism, predators, and those are just the big ones.

A lot of adults don’t even fully understand the dangers and addiction of technology - how easily kids can fall into the rabbit hole of extremism (whether that extremism is proana, incels, racism, the list is endless). They’ll have friends who have unsupervised access to smartphones and tablets.

I don’t even know where to really start. Yes, open communication and exploring together. But by the time I have to really worry about any of this, I will probably be so out of touch with “what the kids are on” that I’ll quite literally have no clue. Heck, if I’m honest I don’t have a clue now! Three years ago it’s was kik and finstas and hidden apps within apps. I don’t even know what I’d be looking for on a tech savvy teens smartphone.

How do you all deal with these anxieties? And what are your plans for navigating?"
Parenting,technology,varpgo,Summer independence and technology,"My daughter is almost 9 years old. We live in a cul-de-sac. So this summer she is being allowed to go play outside without me. I have boundaries for her , no going past the ""curve"" and no going past the stop sign. 
Our local gym also has a kids play night. You can drop your kids off I think it's about 4 hrs she is begging to go as all her friends do. Once dropped off the kids are locked inside the building , parents have to show ID for pick up etc I trust the facility I just worry about her emotional maturity to handle that. 

My question is , when do I introduce technology ? As of right now all she has is a Switch. Which is quite locked down. A cell phone worries me but I want her to be able to reach me since she is gaining some independence. 
Anyone have any luck with smart watches ? I've been looking at the Gabb since it doesn't require any kind of contract and also less likely to lose or drop something that is attached 😅"
Parenting,technology,shk593,My 4-year-old has an obscure interest in engineering/technology,"Hey there! I’m in need of some advice/support for parents of children with obscure interests. My 4-year-old is obsessed with technology…HDMI cables, home automation configurations, Bluetooth pairing, screen mirroring. He watches extremely dry video instructions for setting up TVs, speakers, etc. He drew me a diagram for putting up the Christmas tree, complete with extension cord locations and how to incorporate power to the star on top. I feel absolutely ridiculous even typing these things out. Which leads me to some questions for those who have been in similar  or parallel circumstances: 

1. I want to support him and follow his interests, but this isn’t exactly a topic that is young child friendly. The STEM type kits are typically geared for older children and he has all of the limitations in dexterity that one would expect for his age, which makes him frustrated. And I’m not about to let my preschooler play with electricity, in any capacity. I’m at a loss on how to help him pursue these interests that he is clearly passionate about. I also want to find a way to do this while reasonably limiting screen time, because it truly does make him more grumpy and irritable. Any ideas? 

2. His teachers tell me that he’s doing well socially and has close friends he works and plays with daily. He gets invited to birthday parties. But I’m worried these obscure interests will eventually alienate his peers. I don’t want him to become ostracized, because rich social interactions and relationships are so crucial to child development. 

TLDR; 4-year-old has an obscure, passionate interest in engineering/technology, and I’m trying to foster his interest in age-appropriate ways, without alienating his peers. Thanks!"
Parenting,technology,10dnx5c,Need advice/insight about my son (7) who has decided he hates school and refuses to go,"My son is 7 and in 1st grade. He's like me, he's into technology, science, and video games. He is smart, gets good grades, he reads above his grade level and is above grade level in math. I'm not trying to make it sound like more than it is, plenty of kids are as smart as he is, but he's certainly not challenged in school. He has always been stubborn in certain ways. He doesn't want to do what he doesn't want to do.


An example from early childhood - we never could get him to go to sleep on his own. Once he got in a ""big boy bed"" he'd just leave his room no matter what we tried. We could physically put him back in, but he'd just get out again. Over and over for hours, until everyone involved is angry. Eventually we lost the battle of wills and just started laying with him to fall asleep. We still do that some nights although we sort of resigned ourselves to it long ago, it's actually not that bad. I'm just trying to illustrate this part of his personality.


At some point we started letting him play video games, mostly tablet and then Nintendo, and he loved it. We have 2 other kids and it could be such a valuable tool sometimes to occupy him. We've played together, and he loves playing with me, we bond over it. He bonds with friends over it.


I think over the last few years we let it grow beyond a healthy amount. We've always had occasional transition problems because of it, e.g. getting him to turn it off to leave the house, but from what we hear from other parents that is super common. It has recently rocketed past that.


Just before Christmas, he started suddenly and aggressively refusing to go to school. When we ask him why, the thing he most consistently says is that school is boring and takes up too much time. When asked what he'd rather do, he says video games. We've ended up needing to take him kicking and screaming. All last week was like that.


Last Tuesday, we removed all video games. And starting on that first day he certainly showed addict behavior in terms of lashing out. Any time we try to talk to him about it he refuses to see video games as a reward or priviledge for going to school and doing well, he only sees it as we've taken them away. Oddly, the majority of the time he has been fine. He's started playing with regular toys more, he will still watch some TV, he's started playing outside more, he's gotten a little into chess, etc. But when the topic comes up, he has not really come around. He is saying now that he will go to school tomorrow even though he doesn't want to, but we'll see. I will not be surprised at all if he refuses.


We've tried to question him to find ANY other reason that could be related to this, and it does seem like there may be some social issues happening too. He has said school is ""overwhelming"" and that he sometimes thinks other kids are distracting, or he can't make friends with all the kids becuase there are so many. But trying to get deeper into this gets inconsistant answers and he certainly doesn't stress it as much as ""school is boring"" or it ""takes up too much time.""


The school staff is supportive, and will help us get him in the door and into class. They've tried talking him. They've told us that they do see this kind of thing with a few kids per year. But they are not telling them anything he's not telling us in terms of what the problem could be. Just that school is boring.


I always liked school, because I was good at it. He's good at it too, but doesn't care about that part. He doesn't want to do well the same way I did. When I think about worst case scenarios, this year could easily be the beginning of him just never caring about school. It's very stressful and heartbreaking to me.


I feel like we've royally fucked up navigating the whole video games thing, and have somehow created this nightmare scenario without realizing it. It all seemed fine until a month ago. We're going to continue to keep video games away and frame it as he has to ""earn them back"", but I don't even know if that is the right approach. Does anyone have advice or insight from a similar situation that might help?"
Parenting,technology,10e2pew,Too much device consumption,"I'm starting to despise the amount of time my kids spend on their devices. I know i am at fault for letting it slide for too long but It's ridiculous and so normalised these days. We buy them game consoles/tablets/mobile phones because we know it's the future, so we can keep in touch (teens), help with their learning, homework and technology skills (young ones) but the amount of time they spend on gaming, social media, posting for 👍💕👀 And the things they are consuming is toxic 💩. Plus, they are becoming like zombies on it.

My eldest used to love to write short stories and draw, now all she wants is to post silly dances to YT. Iv'e always kept things to private but since she got a phone for her 11th bday, she is in loads of group chats and just wants to 'perform' and become a Youtuber. My youngest 4yo, just wants to watch videos of other people playing online games..WtF is this lool? 
And i get it, it's highly addictive, reasons why i no longer entertain FB or Insta. I swear them sites were impacting my mental health, and Fk TikTok.  Not to mention when the devices inevitably Break down, My kids have a mini break down too, expecting a sudden refix or renew as if Foods and Bills don't come first. 

So, Iv'e decided to ban devices for a few hours a day and replace it with reading books, craft,  drawing or painting for an hour a day (After school) at least. Is it just me who feels this way regarding our kids and their devices?? Any other suggestions are welcomed. Wish me luck mamas and daddos 🤞🏽.

Edit: We do plenty of outdoor activities whitch they love too..pending the weather. Parks, nature walks, visitsing farms, picniks, bike rides, seaside holdays etc. Im just referring to cold season when stuck in the home."

Parenting,technology,10pa3cl,Child who only misbehaves with mom,"My daughter is 7. I am told at school she is a very well behaved child. Other people compliment me on how well behaved my children are so it boggles my mind how whiny and sensitive she is at home. Lately, she has a full blown tantrum if she does something and is not able to do it on first try. Like her piano lessons, if a song is hard. She gives up so easily. When doing homework at home, she relies on me to help her with everything even though I know she’s fully capable. I tell her to do it alone but again a full meltdown. Also she’s is very needy. Always wants to be hugged or adult attention. She doesn’t know the meaning of personal space with many people. As a toddler, she was incapable of playing independently or became bored so easily. Lately, all she wants is technology, but I’ve limited this as I see her behaviour is getting worse and her attention span is also worsening. I’m losing my patience lately with how needy she is or with the whining. She is a very intelligent girl, so not sure where the behaviour is coming from recently. Any advice?"
Parenting,technology,10r2jnx,Am I the only one who thinks this?,"What bugs me the most is how technology and internet ( including socials) has evolved to now targeting and garnering children's attention and yet parenting system is more or less the same and in some aspects lacking. Many might say I monitor my child's Internet, but there are some obscene things that you would be shocked to know that your child knows. Now,  parents are no longer role models or inculcating the mindset, openness, and characters necessary to survive in the world we live in. Rather, we leave them or simply give them space or don't do this or that. There are way too many external influences not to prepare your child for how shitty the world is, that is why there is an increasing and alarming rate of depression, low self esteem, lack of confidence and drug addiction in our society ( too many dregs to mention). You might not like it, but it is the truth. A mother hen sits on her egg and warms it until it hatches, yet follows her hatchlings around protecting and showing them the experience of how harsh the environment is, until she determines that they can survive on their own.

We can argue whether the world is a good place or not, but we, as adults, know and have seen the evil and treacherousity in it. So why are parent not preparing their children? Why are they simply leaving children in their own space to consume whatever information it childish mind can barely process. I am currently looking for discussion or talks on this. Message if interested.
Thank you."
Parenting,technology,10k7132,12year old daughter talking inappropriately with boyfriend,"This boy is a bad influence. A couple weeks ago she kept everything rated G and now all of a sudden she's telling him he can do what he wants with her and she's calling him daddy. I feel like I can put a stop to this now, as I plan on taking her tablet away for at least a month and if she does get it back she has to keep her door open while using it. I am divorced from her father and I'm skeptical about telling him because I know his punishment is going to be super harsh and he's going to want to sign into her account and see for himself and I know she would be horrified... and I know he wouldn't let her attend this dance she has her heart set on going to. She's a good kid and she didn't send pictures or anything. Am I wrong if I try to handle this on my own and let her know that if she behaves this way again that I'm telling her dad everything? I plan on having along talk with her and establishing stricter rules. She doesn't have access to technology at her dad's house so she can't get away with anything at his house and she doesn't see her boyfriend out of school so they won't be left unsupervised or anything. I also planned on talking with this boys mother. What would yal do in this situation? I want my daughter to be able to come and talk to me about anything."
Parenting,technology,10a739u,How do you control your preteen/teens cell phone use?,"Hi! So I (33f) am a single mom to a 12 year old girl. Her cell phone use issues are starting to really escalate and I have been on the phone with her school almost daily since she returned from Christmas break. Its clear she is not using her phone in a safe and smart way. (befriending people on Snapchat she doesn't know; receiving shirtless and below the belt photos of boys and showing other kids; sending photos of herself in a bra and thong; if she is sent something from someone else making fun of another kid she is continuing to keep the photo going, even if it is just showing her close friends; taking Snapchat photos with her friends in the locker room in their bathing suits, ect) 

Please no bashing.... I am genuinely trying to seek some advice and suggestions as to what has worked with other people and their own preteen daughter. Please share any rules you might have regarding phone use and what works... Do you have certain parental controls on the phone or apps? Do you only allow them to have the phone at certain times? Any resources you can share that I might be able to utilize to educate myself more on the technology or better communication with my child? 

For context... She does see her father weekly but he lives an hour away and they arent that close and he really isnt all that present or playa an active roll in trying to tackle any issues. She does have a ""step dad"" that has been in her life for the past 4 years but he is a veteran and his military like way of approaching situations I don't necessarily agree with and he encourages her to fight back or say something back to kids which is only getting her into more trouble for reacting. So I'm really quite alone with parenting and discipline.  

Her and I are attending a social media workshop tonight at her school that will go over safe phone use and various apps. I plan on keeping her phone during the day rather than her bring it to school, she is being set up with an in school counselor and I will be getting suggestions for local therapists from her. So I am really trying my best to get this under control now before it gets unmanageable but could certainly use some advice from others who have been there or are in my shoes. 

Thank you!"

Parenting,technology,103o3yy,Cell Phone for Kids: What’s the Right Age?,"My daughter is 10 and will be 11 this summer, entering 6th grade (middle school) next year. She has an iPad at home and we allow her access to technology and social media, so she can already call/text friends, see TikTok, play Roblox, etc.

This strategy has proven to be great thus far because she always comes to us to ask questions, work through a hurtful or rude situation with friends, ask what certain things mean. Having the chance to have a conversation and teach her etiquette and social coping skills for the tech part of her life feels important in helping her navigate it at a later age, when stakes are higher and parents are not as involved.

This being said, she is one of a very few 5th graders who doesn’t have a phone. Most had them in 3rd and 4th grade. I’m not sure why this feels like a big next step but it does. Phones seem like a huge potential distraction at school, cameras, texts, etc. can turn inappropriate when a group of peers and no parental supervision is inconvenient (ie, the bus). We are considering it for next school year when she enters 6th grade. 

What age did your child get a phone? How did it go? What were the rules that worked for your family? I’d love to hear."
Parenting,technology,y4nqnf,Should I Get My Kids a Tablet,"My kids are both young, one in JK (4 y.o.) and the other in SK (5 y.o.). I am thinking about buying each of them a tablet for Christmas. The primary reason will be for educational purposes; we are considering a few different apps like ABC Mouse (other suggestions welcome, we are in Canada). But also for them to watch their videos/cartoons and music. They get about 2-3 hours a week of screen time each week but we listen to music quite often. I intend to have them do about 30 min of education most days of the week so I figured a tablet would be the best and most convenient for the kids to use. 

Are my kids too young to be getting their own tablet? If not, anything suggestions for any good android tablets? I am current looking at the Galaxy Tab A8 and the Lenovo Tablet P11 with the G90T. 

Thanks in advance.

Edit: definitely some mixed feelings about this but I appreciate everyone's perspective as it definitely seems to have it's pros and cons. My wife and I both work full-time very demanding jobs. It can be difficult to find the energy after work to go through lessons and even finding resource material, so I am hoping we can get done support from some of the educational apps that are available. My kids don't know how to use tablets so I would be setting them up and will be there with them as they work through their lessons. 

My approach will be to allow them to get comfortable with technology and for them to understand that it can be very useful but there are dangers that they need to be aware of. Just like everything, moderation will be key."

I’m personally not very good with technology (especially for a millennial), and don’t use it for more than basic email, Reddit (obviously) and Netflix. But I’m coparenting with someone very familiar with and interested in technology who allows our kids lots of access. 

I tried to keep my house low-tech (only watching shows or movies together, otherwise off line), and since the kids don’t really have strong online friends / relationships, I felt okay about it. 

But sometimes I just really need a break or a nap (I work nights and then don’t have a babysitter the next day), so I started to allow them to play their games, like Among Us, Fortnite, and Roblox. I just got an email from my ex, though, that the kids are getting through his more extensive controls and talk about how to get through mine. (I didn’t even know I had controls, but apparently “restricted access” is automatically turned on in YouTube and is enough of a control that they feel like they need to mess with it.)

Can someone please tell me easy, effective ways to keep them safe online? I do mean easy, as so much of this is overwhelming for me. I don’t even know all of the things I should be blocking against, much less how.

Parenting,technology,100szc8,When to stop giving in to crying,"TLDR below. 
My (28F) daughter (9m) is a relatively well behaved baby. She’s extremely active and fun. She is my first, so maybe I don’t have the best frame of reference. Although I have nannied, babysat and helped raise my niece. I feel like she can be a handful sometimes, but that doesn’t really bother me. My husband has ADHD, and although we’re aware it’s too early to actually tell we both think she has it as well. I don’t mind playing with her despite the fact that she wants to play with this and that and is all over the place. However when I cook she wants to be held. Every. Single. Day. For every meal I cook. I cut things with a knife, and cook it spattering oil, etc. so I don’t want to hold her. She cries, and cries, climbs on my legs and holds her arms out to ask to be held. I wait until her cries simmer down a bit and eventually pick her up. Is this wrong? We’re told that a baby can’t be spoiled right? What age does that stop being the case? Should I wait until she completely stops crying to pick her up? Should I not pick her up at all?

Another thing, we went from zero screen time to up to 2 hours/day of Ms Rachel about two weeks ago. Her energy is just too much to handle sometimes and we need a break. I’m still pretty anti technology so I have an insane amount of guilt when I turn it on. How do you guys handle your kids energy? Any tips for no screen time at this age? We have plenty of toys. Not too much, but definitely enough. 

TLDR: My baby cries and I pick her up. When do I stop? When does it become an issue to give into your baby’s squeals?"
Parenting,technology,yyekhj,Guide on how to survive as a single 19 year old father (COVID edition!),"This is actually just a rant phrased in my own creative, sarcastic way. But on the weird off chance that someone can learn something from this, glad I could help.

This guide is for those who: Have no family, have no partner, have no money, have no education, and live in one of the most expensive cities in the USA

*Step 1:* Understand that having a child despite the situation listed above is probably the worst decision you could make. Do not get someone pregnant. Especially not an ex during a one night stand who will dump the baby on you and disappear into the night out of spite

If you fail step 1, continue with this guide

*Step 2:* Work during the pregnancy. You have nine months to save. You may not have family but the mother does. Move in with her and her family and just work. The schedule that works best is: 16 hour shift, 2 hours to unwind at home with hobbies, 5 hours of sleep, 1 hour in the morning to shower and get ready for work. Most jobs won't let you work 7 doubles so take on a 2nd part time job and work doubles on the days your 1st job is forcing you to take off. DO NOT TAKE DRUGS. DRUGS ARE EXPENSIVE. DRUGS WILL MAKE YOU CRASH. LET YOUR BRAIN DEVELOP A SCHEDULE AND LET IT AUTOPILOT. It's ok if you lose track of time, if don't remember the last 2 weeks, whatever. Just don't stop.

*Step 3:* Baby is here! All that money saved can buy you supplies and equipment! What's that? The mother has dissapeared into the night and her parents have no reason to let you stay in their house if their daughter is no longer there? Welp time to make use of Reddit! Redditors are usually safer than Craigslist. Post on your cities subreddit explaining your situation and ask for a place to stay. Keep your rent budget between 300-500 per month and hope to God someone is kind enough to accept. If not, put baby into government care.

If someone is letting you stay in their basement for cheap, continue with the guide

*Step 4:* Make use of your time at home. Newborns need a lot of attention! Use all that money you saved up to spend time with the little one for the next couple months. During that time, it's time to get an education. Getting a GED online is super quick and easy, so make sure to complete that ASAP. As soon as you have that, apply for a tech bootcamp. Cybersecurity is usually a good one to go for. Ivy league schools like California Institute of Technology even offer 3 month bootcamps for cheap! You're now 14k in debt but they look GREAT on resumes!

*Step 5:* The baby is 3 months old now, and you're running out of savings. That's bad. The good news? You're now ""technically"" a college graduate. More good news? The government provides Headstart for your child for free since you're such low income! Put that lil  cutie into the nearest program and that grants you 6 hours of free time Monday-Friday. Time to look for a remote job.

*Step 6:* Coming to terms with the fact your certificate is worthless and you've essentially been scammed. No one will hire you with only a bootcamp education. You've wasted $14,000, and a bachelors from WGU would have been worth more AND cheaper. The silver lining? Sales positions.

*Step 7:* Abandon all morals. It's survival of the fittest. You and your child is all that matters. No matter whose life you ruin, no matter how many people hate you, it's time to sell insurance. As a college graduate, you qualify to work for a high end insurance agency. These are just legal scam centers. You will be informing people on the regular, that they do not qualify for maximum reimbursement due to whatever bullshit lies your manager wants you to make up. Everyone will hate you. But oh god, the commission pay. The more you screw people over, the more money you make. COMMISSION PAY DOES NOT ALWAYS WORK. SOME MONTHS WILL BE BELOW MINIMUM WAGE. DURING THOSE MONTHS, ONLY EAT BREAKFAST. SAVE ALL MONEY FOR THE BABY, THEY ARE EXPENSIVE. NOTHING SHOULD EVER CHANGE FOR HER. 3 MEALS A DAY, SCHOOL, BUBBLE BATH, NICE CLOTHES, DIAPERS. SHE SHOULD FEEL NO CHANGE EVEN IF YOU'RE STRUGGLING. KEEP THE LIL ONE HAPPY

*Step 8:* Use your sales experience to move into a legit sales position. Digital marking consultant is an entry level position you can get just using your certificate & year of sales experience. Become an account manager and work with businesses on their ad campaigns. Use the scummy tactics you learned in insurance to maximize profits for businesses. Stretch the truth, find loopholes. The more money they make, the more money you make. And best part? You aren't ruining anyones life this time. Just making people buy products that don't quite work the way they thought it would. An easy recovery, a learning experience if anything. 

*Step 9:* Climb the corporate ladder. Commission pay only works if you're working hard. Some months are a struggle, others are great. You have a child, you want consistently. Climb to a manager position, get a salary. 

*Step 10:* Rent your own place and move out of the redditors basement you've been living in

Sarcastic guide is over. I'm moving into a house this Monday. My daughter is turning 3 next month and she's both happy and healthy. I didn't talk much about the actual child raising part in my rant but she has never been without necessities. I have never let her schedule change. I think she's picked up on my stress growing up because she's got some very clingy tendencies. I've probably caused her to need therapy later down the line just from our situation. But we're alive. I'm making a comfortable living wage, starting from literal zero 3 years ago. I've had some weird run ins with her mom, her moms family, and my family all trying to take her from me. This has been 3 years of fighting, struggling, and luck to get here. I wish this lifestyle on no one. I can only hope I've made the right decisions to keep my child happy and healthy."

How old are they? Do you allow your middle schooler/high school to own a phone? Do they get social media? Do you take their phones at night/or at random to see what they are doing?

Parenting,technology,zxo08f,Normal fall/winter sick vs 2022/2023 fall/winter sick,"Alright parental units with more experience than I.

My 3 year old and 18 month old both started daycare this fall. I don't think there's been a single day that one or both of them haven't been actively sick - by which I mean symptoms are in full swing as opposed to symptoms that just won't stop after a weekish.

My expectations for this year weren't unreasonable, I think. I expected to be sick once a month with the kids being offset by a few days between each other. I expected that I would get sick to go along with that but, as I'm an adult and work from home, I can dose myself with enough NyQuil to take out an elephant to keep working. I expected every now and again to be blindsided by something on the level of the flu/RSV/COVID. I expected some sleepless nights while one or the other or both needed comfort throughout the night.

What we've had has been overlapping colds without end. A bout of flu and adenovirus at once keeping kiddo sick as a dog for just shy of a week with a stupidly high fever. Every time I think we have whatever the current sick is on the run, another one takes its place. I've had a cough that hasn't abated since the end of November. I'm on bout two of agony in my chest as a result thereof (pulled muscle but ones that apparently you use lifting and breathing and coughing and sneezing and moving). Doctor's orders are to rest as there's nothing else that can be done (lungs are clear and no breathing issues). My husband has come down with the flu/adenovirus as well. I've been caring for someone for the last six weeks without a break.

I haven't had a chance to go shopping for much (thank technology for grocery delivery). I'm afraid to admit how long it's been since I've cleaned the place - I haven't even been able to vacuum daily as I usually do let alone anything more in depth. Laundry...well I think the small humans have spent days in the same PJ's at a time and it's a good thing I haven't been able to leave the house or else I'd be going naked for a lack of clean clothes.

Is....is it going to be like this every fall/winter for the next say...ten years until the eldest can be a bit more proactive with caring for himself? ie. Can be left to sleep as much as they want without having to pick them in and out of bed? Or leaving them in front of the TV without needing additional entertainment on a constant basis? Or were my original expectations actually what the ""norm"" is (plus or minus a bit of variation due to ages and virus changes)?

Someone wanna give me hope or should I be ordering a cleaning service for the Sept - Apr season every year and budget for grocery delivery during that time frame as well?"
Parenting,technology,s75t1m,In need of some advice on technology w/12 year old son,"Title kinda says it all.


 My son got a cell phone for his birthday and Christmas. He saved up for 2/3 of it and the other 3rd myself and my family purchased the phone outright for him. I pay for the month to month bill.  I encouraged this because it's teaches him budgeting skills and it is part of a safety plan I have with my kids (my kids are in a split custody situation and they are to contact me if anything goes down at his Mom's house-- no real parenting happening there and left alone for long periods of time).  In the past when I have contacted their Mom to talk to the kids she ignores my requests for the most part.  

Even before he got a cellphone he was exhibiting a lot of negative behavior around limits with his screen time.  In my home hes not allowed access to screens from Sunday to Thursday unless it is school related.  On non school days he can have as much access as he wants.  At his mother's house hes allowed an hour to two hours a day.  

 Over Christmas holidays his mom's house all ended up with covid and has not been with me for three-ish weeks.   During that time I would text him every day to 3 days just to see how he was doing and no response.  He's been warned about this multiple times and I'm thinking about pulling his devices until he starts responding or until I can alter his devices so that I can monitor them.  

 I was going to have a discussion with him about the expectations in regards to his devices.   I want him to understand that his decisions impact not only himself but his sister and potentially me legally and financially.  I do not want to take away the  devices from him but as this plays out I may have to until I get that buy in.  


Any insight or advice would be helpful

***edit - for clarity I have concerns about booze, drugs and parenting at their Mom's place.  She does bare minimum for parenting, has called my phone not right of mind asking to speak to the kids and is very manipulative.  Devices are part of my kids safety plan to contact me or other family members if something happens so ensuring texting and communication habits with myself and family is really important***"
Parenting,technology,wsi3v4,Kid free space after 8PM,"How do you all feel about having a “kid free zone” after a certain time before they go to bed? Like for example, 8pm rolls around and your kids go play in their play area or their bedroom away from your living room or where you’re relaxing. They have their technology, toys, etc to play with. They’ve already done all their bedtime routines so no need for you to worry about that later. It’s considered quiet hours and they’re not allowed to come barreling in and bug you during “adult time / kid free zone” typically they’ll stay up to 9:30pm and then get a notification on their clock to let them know it’s time to go to bed (electronics auto turn off then too) I know there are kid specific clocks or similar items like “The Hatch” to get them used to timing and being more independent.

I need some quite time with my spouse after a long day. I start my day at 4am in order to workout before I dive into helping get kids ready for school and getting myself to work. After work consists of 5pm pick ups, dinner, sports, and other needs. By the time the kids go to bed, I’m basically ready to go to bed too. My wife and I hardly get 1:1 time with one other M-F due to the schedule. The little ones go to bed at 7pm and the elementary age kids usually stay up til 9:30pm since our school district starts later. I’m typically in bed by 9pm myself due to the early wake up so again little to no time for my wife and I or just individual quiet. Just looking to carve out at least an hour in the evenings from 8pm-9pm for her and I. 

Elementary + age kids. Obviously babies and the pre-k age group go to bed earlier (at least in our household it’s 7pm, they can’t hang any longer lol)

Parenting,technology,yx83wh,Parental controls for teenagers? Especially for smartphones? Feels like all or nothing.,"I'm not trying to go completely psycho, but my kid has behavior issues. Most would refer to her as a ""troubled teen."" I just want to find a middle ground between, ""I have a phone for safety, to contact my friends, any hotlines or anything needed for resources, and to use the apps my parent chooses"" and ""I have free reign to anything."" At one point she had a flip phone which was the medium point, but she was made fun of at school because we are kinda poor compared to others in our area, and after better behavior over the summer I bought her a prepaid smartphone. She has backslid in behavior and it is apparent her relationship with the internet  The thing is, she is 13. I looked to see if I could add Google Family Link to her device which seemed like a great idea but it says after 13 they can opt out of any supervision. If this would just lock the device, that would be great! She can agree to be supervised, or only be able to access emergency numbers. This however does not seem to be the case.

What I am looking to do:

1. Block specific numbers. During my child's time with her father she began meeting strangers on Discord and her interactions with some of these people are... problematic at best. However, on the no contract phone plan I was on, I had no access to block specific numbers. I thought since the phone was under my name I could do that or view some kind of call log, but that was not the case.
2. Possibly view incoming text/phone call logs. This is not to be completely crazy, it is to see if there are recurring phone numbers that are not local that pop up.
3. Be able to turn off data usage period at will. (Smartphone) The reason I want this is because if school is not attended I want to be able to turn off data entirely for the day. On or off. And control the hours it may be used.

&#x200B;

What I have already done/have brainstormed:

1. Discord is blocked entirely on my router. You have to be on phone data, which she had a limited amount so she could not really use it excessively.
2. May possibly block Tiktok/Instagram and some other big social medias until trust can be rebuilt. (She has been sneaking, lying, etc. and it needs to stop. She can have a life, but lying and sneaking is something that has escalated and I want to put an end to it.)
3. Have learned how to use my IP address to view what is being accessed via wifi
4. Will be adding Firewalla most likely, which will show me spikes in bandwidth to know if a VPN is being used via large bandwidth usage alerts to bypass the controls in place.

&#x200B;

If anyone has any suggestions or advice for parental controls for kids who are 13+ but aren't making wise choices with technology other than turning everything off and only providing them with a ""dumb phone"" please let me know. I will do the dumb phone if I have to, but she does have a hard time making friends here and has a few she has made when she came with me to anime conventions and such, and she does like to play games with them and stream things and I don't want to take that from her unless I have to since she has a hard time fitting in with the kids around here."
Parenting,technology,zx9yr3,Questions about tablet for 5 year old,"Feeling like it's time to bite the bullet and get a tablet for our daughter who is about to turn 5. We've held off for long enough. 

Looking for thoughts on platform: iPad vs Amazon Fire Kids vs Amazon Fire Kids Pro?

I have heard that the Amazon Fire Kids gives much better parental controls, but I'm also nervous about starting a whole new ecosystem since we already have iPads in the house. Also curious about access to apps like Disney+ and Netflix etc, particularly does it give access to multiple account levels (ex she loves Finding Dory but it's not available for Kids in Disney+ and needs to be accessed on one of the parent accounts. Will we be able to switch accounts to give her access to that? etc?)

I know I'll probably get hit with a bunch of comments saying ""don't get a tablet"" but the reality of the world we live in is that she will be using tablets in school when she starts Kindergarten in September and we want her to be fluent in the technology that she'll be using as part of her education.

Thoughts? Advice? What do we need to know before taking the plunge?"
Parenting,technology,ywi17u,A 12yo Nightmare!!!!,"Myself (35m) and my GF (38F) have no idea how to handle her kid (12F). At our witts end.

My GFs daughter R, has been acting out for a while and it just continues to get worse. A year ago she was suspended from school for bringing a knife after she told a fellow classmate she was going to stab her the day before. She has been in therapy and regular psychiatrist visits since. Everything was going well.

Fast forward 6 months, get a call from the school counselor stating they were told from another source that R had tried to overdose on her meds. She was committed for an involuntary psych eval. They said everything was fine and to continue with therapy and started adjusting her meds. Seemed like everything was well until the beginning of the school year. One week after she went back to school she suspended. This time for smoking pot in the gym locker room. She's since started drug counseling mandated by the school and completed a month of alternative school. She was allowed back to her school and 2 days later was suspended again for smoking pot in the bathroom.

Now she has a 90 day suspension and has gone completely off the rails. She is completely defiant with zero concern for consequences. She sneaks out at night and has recently been caught with a group of 17yo boys. She gets physical everytime her mother tries to talk to her. She has had all technology removed but still continues to sneak out.

We are at a loss right now and are seriously concerned for her safety. Does anyone have any advice on how to handle this? Or a program that we could possibly get her into? Any help is appreciated."

Parenting,technology,z9xl25,To limit or not to limit internet usage for teen,"Backstory: My daughter (15F) was brought up reading books with limited access to tablets, phones, internet etc.  That changed last year when we decided to get her a phone to have her be able to reach us for emergencies.  Both wife and I are aware of online dangers and the harm that too much of anything can cause.  I work in IT and also know the benefits that have come about due to advancements in technology.  Internet access has literally changed peoples lives for the better.  Yet, I'm also aware of the negatives associated with an unbalanced consumption of online entertainment.  Having learned about 85% of what I know today by listening to podcasts, Youtube videos, blogs, etc., I knew my two girls were missing out on all the knowledge that is available online.  Therefore, we gave my eldest more computer/internet time around the time we got her the phone last year.  Before last year, most of what she consumed online was Youtube Kids, educational animated videos and Nickelodeon re-runs.  Last year she moved on to watching reruns of other TV shows and this year she watches Youtube Shorts mostly of people trying to be funny.  Prior to last year, she would read a couple of books per week (she can speed read as she started reading when she was 2yr).  Now she rarely picks up a book.  

Most of what she consumes online is entertainment and she can sit there all day if we do not interrupt her to do her chores.  Naturally, she gets upset when we pry her away from the screen.  She is in all advanced classes and is doing ok academically for the most part.  My concern is that instead of being motivated or inspired to learn new things, all her free time is consumed by binge-watching Youtube influencers.  Therefore, I'm considering limiting internet access to a couple of hours per day, especially on Saturdays.  However, I don't just want to impose it on her.  I'm considering waning her off it by making her interested in other activities.  The problem is I cannot seem to motivate or inspire her to do other things.  Not too long ago I told her I'd pay her to create me a simple app (she was introduced to block coding last year in school).  My hope was that she would do online research on how to go about it.  She was highly motivated at first but gave up the next day and went back binge-watching Youtube.  This week I offered to pay her to research content and draft an article for a new parenting blog I want to start as a family project.  Again, she seems very motivated and we'll see if she can pull through.  Do you have any advice for limiting internet consumption without actually imposing it?"

Parenting,technology,yfyli7,Help please 19yr old and….,"** Clarification Me (M42), Wife (44), Son (19.5yrs)

I recently married the love of my life (42). I love my new son (going on 20), for the most part he likes me, he loves me and when he is in his very smart “adult brain” absolutely knows we do everything with love and want to help him transition into adulthood. His upbringing has been extremely light on accountability and responsibility, I do understand this not to be easy. 

His entitlement spirit is very strong. He feels he is owed everything. He is not appreciative without coaxing, has never had a job (before the one his Mom got him below 8hrs a week @$35/hr). Regular jobs seem beneath him.  

Over the last 2yrs there has been many many issues centered around heavy technology addiction. Many lies, hacking school equipment, intentionally smashing school equipment (sense graduated). Throwing fits etc. 

As a result, He has had long stretches without and reduced technology use, never long stretches assigned at once, he just keeps doubling down and making things worse for himself.

While it was hard, many great things grew from this. He started to hang out with friends (something very rarely done before), he was very excited about riding his BMX and Onewheel, he was working on business development (his Mom got him helping seniors with technology at the buildings he works with and we have been helping him step by step by step to grow his business creating fliers, price structures, practice phone calls, ideas, ect). He even had his first relationship. He has commented a few times that he is thankful for the new perspective, he sees the importance of time “to just think.” He carried himself better, more social with us, and was on top of his chores with a good attitude. During this time his access to technology grew and grew. (Every 3 days) Even if he slipped up, he would own his mistakes more quickly and it was rewarded with positivity and no negative consequences.  (Maybe prolong the next tech bump by a day)

As his use becomes less regulated into total freedom until 10:30 (the time he picked as being fair and helpful to himself to be a productive person), we see a downward spiral into bad habits, less social, less willing to be accountable when he makes mistakes etc. 

He has always been able to negotiate rules to help make the system work better for him. We welcome it. We believe if he has a good and “adult mind” about marking real rules he will feel ownership, more likely to be accountable etc. 

This is good until he messes up and the Consequences we all agreed on become too much for him. Then he digs himself into a deep hole that he knows we will not let him languish in, then he gets to negotiate new terms and we start over. That’s generally when we modify the rules. This is a loop I see as teaching him bad habits. 

The more recent larger revamp, he did a great job making a good system that allows him to earn privileges back. He was in a very deep hole and stacked consequences very deep into the future. Under the new rules he started getting back his technology after three days. We do not have consequences for doing a bad job at chores or forgetting. (Forgetting sometimes means doing that chore plus a little bit more or maybe one extra day).

Simple rules: 1. Don’t Lie 2. Get your chores done. 3. Advance on your business or get a job. 

Our emphasis is always about building trust, accountability, mutual respect and personal integrity. When he is in his “adult brain” he is incredibly intuitive and smart and sees these things. When he gets into his “child brain” he burns it down, and in my opinion knows he will get to start over with yet again modified rules. 

He has a therapist, we have a family therapist, we have a couples therapist. We have been following (for the most part) the advice. 

My wife is the most caring person I’ve ever met. She is a social worker, gives seminars on Trauma informed care. We always talk respectfully with each other and as a family. We try and make our hard talks end positively. We begin most hard talks with a reading of our “Contract of Love” 

We are at the beginning of another “burn it down cycle” 

Even when he is at his best we have to coax him along every step to build his business, and when his tech is back that goes away. A year ago he said he only wants to do the bare minimum for a job, and that living with us the rest of his life seemed like a pretty good plan. 

He says we are the assholes for taking his tech away for what would have been 3 days even though we suspended the consequence for a week. 

We got him a house sitting gig right after he lied. Instead of sending him out with just his phone with time limits we let him take his computer for 100% no limit also phone, under the condition we pick up where we left off when he left. Instead of being thankful, he came home and was awful. Horrible attitude, hacking his phone, not coming home or answering txts, and intentionally not doing chores as asked. 

Now my wife and I have a lot of tension and we are leaving tomorrow for our first honeymoon."

Parenting,technology,xsrjx2,I'm a teen parent whose now approaching 40. AmA,"I'm a teen parent who now has adult children. It was rough back then but we have great technology now and advice is everywhere. 
I'd like to share my experience with anyone interested and answer any questions you may have."
Parenting,technology,yhc88r,Deep-ish conversations,"I have an 8 year old daughter that I started a Podcast with. She watched a lot of instructional YouTube videos when she was younger just likes the thought of putting out her own content. I use it as a way to connect with her and hopefully over time have a recording of how she evolves her critical thinking and view of the world. I am thinking I will re-ask some questions in the future to see if her ideas have changed.

So far we've discussed topics like family, the importance of her role in community, how to deal with big life changes, space technology, etc. 

We've stuck with it for 10 weeks/episodes now so I am curious...what are the topics of some of the best conversations you've had with your grade school aged children? Anything that may have been insightful, inspiring, teachable moments, etc? 

I'd love to get ideas for things I may not have thought of yet for her."
Parenting,technology,wt8bue,The past 10 years of pictures and videos of my son growing up are all gone,"Google wrongfully deleted my entire Gmail and Google account, along with all of the pics/vids of my son growing up in my Google Photos. 

Like most of my friends and family, I trusted Google to keep my data safe. My photos, videos, emails, and everything else that were interwoven into my Google account of the past 10 years were permanently deleted. The inconvenience of it is staggering, but the part that has broken my heart is the fact that thousands of pictures and home videos of my son’s infancy and elementary school years are gone forever.  

I was even paying for a Google one subscription to have more storage space. Of course, I have posted pictures and videos to social media, but the good stuff is what you don’t post. Me and my son dancing in our underwear or having silly bath time conversations are just... gone. I was a single mom for 10 years and I made a point to record conversations and silly moments we had together, but now they’re gone. Videos of him reading to me for the first time, or him dressing up in a character and hearing the hilarious backstories he came up with, gone. Sometimes I would just prop up my phone and record us playing a board game or drawing… but now they’re gone too.

I came back from vacation on 7/25 and I wasn’t able to log in to my Gmail. Following Google protocol, I tried to use my recovery email to reset my password and log back in. It didn’t work, but not because I am technically illiterate, but because of Google’s broken system. My brother, who works in IT, along with 3 other tech savvy friends all tried to navigate Google’s help pages and account recovery with zero success. We tried for almost 2 months, hearing NOTHING back from Google. It said my account wasn’t able to log in to for weeks, but a few days ago it said “deleted account.” At this point, all of the countless resources and memories attached to that account are permanently deleted and unretrievable.  

The whole time that I was trying to get back into my account I couldn’t talk to a Google representative that had ANY idea of what to do. The Google help pages and account recovery process are a circle that lead nowhere. You will be at a help page and it directs you to another help page… that leads you back to the first help page, and it never ends. You are unable to talk to a single person from Google that can help you. If you call the Google help number, it has an automated system and if you select the option of trying to get back into your account it tells you to go to the help pages, then hangs up on you. I was able to find another route to talk to a Google representative on a few separate occasions and they said there is no department for helping people in these situations. The only advice they were able to give was to go to the help pages, that’s it. I asked if there was ANYONE else I could talk to at Google that could help me and they simply said no.

Yesterday I bought a new Google one account with the new email I had to create. I saw that they have LIVE CHAT SUPPORT so I talked to someone there. Being able to talk to a knowledgeable person from Google was such a relief! I wish that the people I had previously talked to about trying to log back into my account had let me know that this was an option. The only thing that the chat support could tell me was that since my account was now deleted it was unrecoverable. If ANYONE else at Google had directed me to this kind of chat support before it was deleted, it could have been salvaged. All of the precious memories of my son and I would still be here.  

I am completely devastated and beyond upset at Google’s incompetence. My whole life was on Google. So many accounts that were linked that I no longer have access to, for absolutely no reason. My accounts like Airbnb, Uber, Lyft, and countless others that I had great reviews on are deleted forever. I don’t even know where to begin rebuilding after this loss. I feel so lost and betrayed. I always thought that Google was on the cutting edge of technology, yet they couldn’t help a mother with simply getting back into her account. I will be forever heartbroken at what they cost me. 

I'm at the end of my rope and I'm not sure what to do.  Please let me know if y'all have any thoughts on this."
Parenting,technology,mwhewt,How much technology time are other teenagers getting?,"My almost 14 year old son, our oldest of 3 boys, is convinced that my wife and I are being unreasonably controlling about his computer and technology time. We have intentionally limited our kids use of television to only weekends, which includes switch and Xbox. They will get a movie during school nights every so often. 

He has an iPhone that turns on at 7:15 am and shuts off at 9:30 pm. Apple Screen Time is a joke of a software, but it does shut down apps at the time it’s supposed to. He also does not have safari or any browser on his phone. (Not that he can’t get to a browser otherwise, ie screen time sucks and you can open safari through gmail app). He also uses a laptop for homework, to voice chat on discord and will sometimes be allowed to play Minecraft after his homework is done. 

I feel like the limitations we’ve put on technology are reasonable for a 14 year old. But I would love to hear how other parents have limited their teenagers use of tech and what they think of our process.

Update:

Thank you to those who provided constructive help for us. We needed to hear how others are handling this issue. We are parents who are working hard on creative ways to help our children grow up in this new environment of the digital age. Many of you have head great empathy for us and I Iearned some things. 

For those who insist on the gatekeeping and use parent shaming. Please think about your approach to helping other parents who are asking for help. Many of you shamed me because you believe that we are ludites and acting like we are locking our children in their bedroom whenever they have free time. 

1. Parenting is not an exact science. Please don’t talk in definitives. 

2. Parenting is hard. Please speak encouraging words not shaming words. 

3. Parenting is the responsibility of those who are the caretakers of those kids. Every child is different. Just because you’ve seen something that works or doesn’t work for one child, doesn’t mean that result will be the same for another."
Parenting,technology,ob7wcn,The role of technology for children,"Full disclosure of my personal bias on this topic: I am an IT guy for a school system so educational technology is kinda my job. I am also 26 so I grew up on technology since probably the Playstation1 and Gameboy color. Should we reevaluate the negative outlook for kids using tablets and computers and ""screen time"" at a young age? My son is 4 and for his 4th birthday I got him an Amazon kids tablet and installed all the educational apps we install on our Pre K and Kindergarten iPads they use for centers. We use technology for teaching almost if not everyday. We just went virtual this past school year because of COVID and everything they did was online for about half the year. The kids who were the most behind were the kids who just wanted to skip all their core classes and just play in the AG shop all day. Kids who didn't have a computer at home to be familiar with. 

Technology is now slowing down folks and is certainly not reversing. If kids don't keep up and are proficient with technology the world will leave them behind.  I have heard here and there about how bad tablets and computers are for kids but I am unsure about the metric being used to describe them as ""bad."" What say ye? Is technology still the devil as it was suggested my whole childhood or is it a necessity in the world we live in today?"
Parenting,technology,xun4od,How to dissuade my kid from breaking the tech rules,"Hey everyone! I have an 11 year old who is starting to break into the preteen stage. When I first introduced them to connected tech I set the ground rules for its usage 1) don't download apps without permission 2) don't talk to anyone on the internet. 

I figure once they get older these rules will change a little bit but every time they've been given access to technology they've immediately broken these two rules. These rules have been made clear from day one and are even written on a whiteboard that sits in their room. Besides the obvious losing access to all technology in general as a punishment, what are some other ways I can encourage them to obey the rules? I've tried providing incentives like getting a phone or a drawing tablet that they've always wanted but each time they break the rules they're showing they can't be trusted with that sort of technology.

I appreciate any help and advice y'all can give! Thanks!"
Parenting,technology,r27516,"First foray into technology, thoughts? Recommendations?","Possible overthink warning!

Grandma is wanting to get my 3.5yo a tablet for Christmas. So far he’s had very limited screen time, half an hour of gentle/slow paced tv shows some days. Hubby and I work in tech and love it so I’m not anti tech at all as long as it’s not misused/overused or at the expense of other important activities/skills eg messy play, fine motor activities etc etc at this age.

So I’m on board with the idea but I want to make sure we choose something with good restrictions options, identify high quality apps without ads, and ideally look for extension options that bring physical play and tech together eg Osmo. 

I’m so far leaning towards the Fire tablet and an Osmo kit but I’m concerned the App Library might be too limited? 

Is there anything else out there like Osmo?

Great apps for this age range?

And just any thoughts on what to be aware of with taking this step? Feels like a bit of a minefield!"
Parenting,technology,vekh57,Helping to replace a laptop my son accidentally damaged - am I being unreasonable?,"Am I being unreasonable here?

I got a call from my middle schooler’s assistant principal weeks ago. A classmate of my son had their Chromebook out on their lap while it was plugged in and charging. My son walks by, doesn’t see the charging cable, trips over it, and it yanks the Chromebook off the other student’s lap. It falls on the tile floor, and apparently was damaged beyond use.

The other parent wanted us to help* pay to replace it, and said the Chromebook was $500.(*assistant principal’s words - maybe they wanted us to pay for it outright.)

Uh … excuse me? Who pays $500 for a Chromebook? And for a middle schooler? Kids aren’t exactly known for being careful at that age. 

I get it though - technology isn’t cheap. But from the sounds of it, this wasn’t completely my son’s fault. Yes, he should’ve been watching where he was going. But anyone who has ever owned a laptop can tell you that if you have it plugged in and charging, it should be on a stable surface. Having it on your lap with the cable across what I’m assuming was an aisle way is a risk.

So I tell the assistant principal that I’m willing to split the cost of a replacement, but I want to see a receipt or get the model of the device first, because I’m skeptical of the cost. I also ask for the other parent’s contact info so the school doesn’t need to act as an intermediary.

Weeks pass, and there’s no response from anyone. I assume that the other parent was told I wasn’t willing to pay for the full thing and decided it wasn’t worth the headache.

I’d nearly forgotten about it, and I get an email from the principal. He sends me the receipt for the laptop: $390 after taxes. The original price was like $480, and it looks like it was on clearance and they got it at a discount.

$390 isn’t $500. I get that it was the original sales price, but it’s not what they paid for it. I tell them I’ll cut a check for $200. Given how the incident occurred, I think that’s more than fair. I also ask again for the other parent’s contact info, as it doesn’t make sense for the school to still be playing middle man.

After some phone tag, I finally speak to the principal today.

He lets me know that the other parent insisted on handling everything through the school. He didn’t want it to be that way, and he didn’t understand why they were so incessant about it. He then tells me that the long delays in responses were because the other parent was angry that I wasn’t going to pay for the entire thing, and first refused the offer. They eventually came around, but it took some convincing.

I tore up the check and opted for cash. Between them being misleading about what they’d paid for the original Chromebook, refusing to speak with me directly, and now this news about them being upset with my offer, I was not comfortable with giving them something that has my home address on it.

This feels like someone being opportunistic and trying to take me for a ride. So no, you get cash.

Thoughts? Am I in the wrong here? Would you have handled it differently?

EDIT: I already dropped off the cash at the school. Maybe I would’ve been in the right to outright refuse, but I see this as paying for this to go away and leave me alone. If they try to push the issue further, that’s when I plan on stonewalling and being a dick about it.

EDIT 2: it was the other student’s personal Chromebook. Our district can provide them, but is mostly Bring Your Own Device.

EDIT 3: my kid wasn’t injured. I’m not even sure if he fell down. As far as I know, he tripped and stumbled."

Parenting,technology,y1rqcb,My 9yo daughter used my phone to text a friend and the friend is abusive to other kids.,"The friend we'll call ""Sam"" -- Sam has spent the night a few times. Sam is high energy with parent who hands child unrestricted technology and runs away. Sam is in cheerleading 8yo (3rd grade) with my daughter. 

I noticed Sam saying some not-so-nice but not rising to the level of bully stuff about some other girls while she was here. 

Sam and my daughter were texting tonight when Sam taught my daughter how to ""hide"" messages on iOS by making the sparkle where you have to move your finger over them. Sam called this other girl a ""butthole bitch"" and then mocked a girl whom she called ""Chicken Leg Susie"" who was having a birthday party this weekend. Then Sam stated she still wanted to do something to someone named  ""Brea"" and my daughter responded ""Fuck him"". 

My phone is synced with my Macbook Pro so I get notifications of incoming messages. I noticed these ""invisible messages"" coming through and thought it was sus. Indeed they were. 

I went upstairs and asked my daughter for the phone. I didn't yell or get upset. I did tell her that we needed to talk about it later. That moment will be tomorrow before school. 

I'm not quite sure how to respond... I want to reply directly to Sam when she messages my daughter and tell her that I'm not giving daughter the phone for a while. Mention a bit about why. I'm worried ZERO about the parents of Sam getting onto me. I also want to tell my daughter that I'm disappointed. Sigh, parenting. Ideas? Thoughts? I will not tolerate my kids being abusive to another kid.. any kid, for any reason. I've seen kids get bullied 30+ years ago including myself and it was disgusting. I also will not tolerate my kids hanging out or being friends with kids who do that."
Parenting,technology,n8xrz6,My 8yo daughter's best friends (twins) have become media/technology addicts!,"So my daughter's closest friends, and the children of long-term family friends, are using more and more digital media - ie games, tik tok, youtube. They are 8 years old and their parents just bought them their own phones (with sim cards). My own daughter started to cry today because she was jealous that her friends had phones and I told her that was a long way off. 

When I go round to their house I rarely see them doing anything else except for sitting watching screens. These kids are also quite reluctant to come to our place anymore because I put limits on the screen time they can have (another problem is I usually give them healthier food than they want to eat but that's a different subject).

Is this a big deal? Am I overreacting? What should I say to the parents? I've raised concerns before but I feel like the situation is getting worse."
Parenting,technology,y3d4a6,Content Filters for Teens,"I have a 16 year old son with a cell phone.   I recently found out the filter I thought was keeping the ""bad"" stuff out has not been working as well as I thought :(  However, I am simultaneously re-evaluating my criteria for ""bad"" stuff and filtering as our family de-programs our religious upbringing.  How do non-religious parents of teenagers navigate technology access to potentially ""adult"" or objectionable content?
 
Background:  Our family (Me(M):42, Wife:39, 5 kids ages 16 - 8) has recently and consciously stepped away from our lifelong religion that we no longer believe.  We are very happy with the decision, but for my entire parenting career, I have looked to the church as an authority for how to parent and what values to enforce.  Pornography is taught as one of the ""great evils of our day"" and I have my own conflicted history with pornography consumption as a teenager and adult which has driven an unhealthy shame-cycle that I am also working to heal from.  I have a much more nuanced view now of porn, recognizing it can be problematic, but also turning down the volume on the 'evil' narrative and recognizing many (most?) adults navigate this in the modern world without their moral foundations crumbling.
 
I want my teenagers to develop into healthy adults capable of managing themselves and I wonder if setting myself up as the ""technology filtering enforcer"" is serving that goal for them and could potentially drive secrecy and shame around sexual indulgence (the brain pattern that I established as a teen and young man which has not served me well).  I want to talk openly with them about this stuff and also want to feel less ownership of how they choose to relate to porn and eroticism in their own lives.  At the same time I recognize my parental responsibility to establish age-appropriate boundaries/guardrails and that access to everything on the Internet for a teen is probably not a good idea.
 
Just interested to know how others have navigated this space with wisdom and intentionality.  Thanks!"
Parenting,technology,vqo42i,AITA for banning tech from 13y,"My husband and I both work in IT (him WAY more) and we have always had lots of technology in our house as a result. 

We have parental controls and over the years have slowly relaxed rules as it was proven our daughter could be trusted. During the school year her phone would automatically lock at 10:00 p.m. and could only be used for emergencies. Since it's summer she requested the lock be removed and since she was at sleepovers I thought it was a fair request and turned it off. 

Last night was her first night at home since this was done. This morning I noticed she hadn't fed the dog or let her out so at 1030 I sent her a text (I am extremely sick and couldn't get up); when she didn't respond I checked and saw that she was on Tik Tok until 2 a.m. 

As a result I've locked her phone (emergency calls allows)  until tomorrow morning, put the night time lock on  and will also been locking her computer during those hours (a couple weeks ago I caught her on her computer at midnight).

I do understand technology and the importance it has for her in communicating with friends (especially when friends live far away).

She is also spending the day cleaning and organizing her room. 

As I said I'm sick so I need to know if I took it too far. I haven't slept in 3 days and fully understand my thought process is messed up as a result.

Thank you

Edit/update:

After she finished cleaning her room  she got her phone unlocked for 1 hour to listen to music while showering. After that she could use the TV

We talked it over and she forgot about the dog completely; she had woken up at 7 then just hung out until she fell back asleep. We talked about being more responsible and about expectations. 

Her phone is unlocked but nighttime locks are back  (11 until 5 unless at a sleepover)

For people saying I'm cruel. She lost her tech for less then a day. She knew it could be taken for as long as a week depending on the infraction and understood the risks but didn't think she would get caught. 

It was honestly a fluke that I noticed at all. I didn't want to wake her up if she was tired so I checked to see if she was using her phone and that's when I saw it.

Thank your comments!"
Parenting,technology,u7qdpe,Which of your parents' parenting techniques do you find outdated?,"For me, it's

\- You finish your plate (no matter how much we put onto it), or if you really can't make it, at least half

\- ""It's not that bad"" (anytime the kid trips and cries)

\- ""No means no"" (no explanation given, no mercy)

\- no new technology (we were allowed TV, but no VCR or gaming consoles)

I might think of some more later.

Edit: a few more came to mind:

\- You have to share whatever you have with basically anyone

\- You're the girl, so it's your job to do xyz

\- You're the older one, so you have to give in/ take care of the younger siblings / do this task

And:

\- what should the other people think of your behavior?"

&#x200B;

In this newsletter, we provide you with notes on Play More, Tech Less with Abby Lynch, an episode of Minimalist Moms Podcast.

Host Diane Boden, is a mother of three and the voice behind the top-rated podcast, Minimalist Moms. Her guest, Abby Lynch, is the creator of the u/playmore_techless.

**Save time and read our notes on play and tech.**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Topics Covered in this Summary**

\- Setting a Healthy Balance around Tech

\- Tech and Developing a Child’s Imagination

\- Taking Control of Screen Time

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Setting a Healthy Balance around Tech**

Tech is a part of our lives and we cannot and do not want to remove it entirely, however, we do want to set healthy boundaries around the use of tech.

Research says that if you are engaging in screen time with your child and sharing that experience with them, it could minimize the detrimental effects of screen time.

Our kids need space to switch off, allowing time for children to develop their imagination.

It’s great to involve children in trying different things and finding flexibility in what works for you and your family.

Abby Lynch explains: Her kid wanted to watch her favorite show after school, but Abby didn’t want to make it a routine. She agreed but asked her kid to try something else the following day.

**The goal is to achieve that balance** and find a variety of non-screen activities that you and your child enjoy doing.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Tech and Developing a Child’s Imagination**

Imagination can’t be taught, and children need opportunities to practice creating images in their minds, consider possibilities, and try out different roles while practicing language through self-talk.

Ways to foster your child’s imagination:

\- **Read books to your child**. It promotes brain development and imagination.

\- **Give your child ideas** on what to do. You may suggest a role-play.

\- **Find and create things** in nature together.

\- **Put out some materials for children to play with** that would spark an idea of their own.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Taking Control of Screen Time**

\- Parents might feel stuck using screens and feel like they can't shift how they've been parenting in this area.

\- Take having a screen in your car as an example. You introduce it on a long journey to pass the time, and the next thing you know, they can’t ride in a car without turning it on anymore.

\- It is important to remember that you have the **ability to take control** because you are the adult. Reset those boundaries and communicate this in an age-appropriate manner.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Parenting Advice To Go**

1. Remind yourself that you're the parent, and you're allowed to say no to using the screen.
2. Talk to your kids about it. No matter how young they are, set boundaries. You may come up with a question such as ‘’I wonder what we could do instead this time?’’.

Parenting,technology,wsy9b4,Apparently controversial opinion: no screen time <2yo is an important guideline,"I wrote a good-faith post (tagged rant, which was a catastrophic mistake because it set up the convo to be contentious😭) in another parenting sub expressing my genuine confusion surrounding the many parents in my mid-sized college town and middle income, educated circle who seem to be totally okay with significant screen time ~under 2yo~ despite the AAP’s recommendation and the mountains of research on the importance of early childhood development. The premise of the post was that I feel judgmental when I see strollers with the iPhone attachment arm and wanted to understand why this was such a permissive gray area for parents (implying there seems to be culture of enabling between folks).

My husband is a pediatrician so he has access to the latest research as well as anecdotes, and one of his mentors actually wrote the guidelines. We both felt passionate about this topic before having a baby (who is now 11mo) and have a strong knowledge/interest in the business, marketing, societal implications of emerging technologies. Note: It is not the only issue we care about nor the one we care about the most. We also support political change that would help parents rely on screen time far less as a tool.  

I responded to almost every comment thoughtfully and there was some really good dialog happening. A few people called me judgmental (which I get because it was the premise of my post) and one said I was offensive (which I don’t get; I had several caveats that my question was aimed at my well-resourced social circle). A good handful of people said it just wasn’t a big deal and that I should mind my own business. 

The post got removed from the sub an hour later, although I didn’t violate any community guidelines. I honestly couldn’t believe it—and have re-read it several times and it still feels innocuous days later. I wrote a note to the mods asking why it was removed but didn’t get a response yet:( 

So, all in all, in a kind of crazy way, the entire experience was an illustration of my original question/concern/confusion/frustration. 

TLDR; wondering if people in this sub have any helpful light to shed on the uphill battle of no screen time under 2, the “how dare you say that” trend across parenting reddit (e.g. ppl coming for the parent today who said they didn’t like mama lingo), or—for parents of older children—reflections on screen time with the benefit of hindsight and their kids’ age-matched peer groups. I’d like to be better equipped to handle this topic more gently and tactfully as I encounter other parents IRL. 

Finally, I’m just wondering where my people are at, ya know? Alt subreddits, book recs, articles, and other resources on this topic welcomed♥️"
Parenting,technology,kz2hyq,Am I wrong for limiting my 12 yr old sons technology use? ...a lot,"I wanted to ask the “world” about what they think about me barely allowing my 7th grader to use technology.  Originally I bought him an iPhone 5 when he was 9 for Christmas.  I thought it would be useful to have while walking a short distance home from school...& it was.  I thought “all the kids have it so maybe, I guess, I’ll buy him One.  Very quickly it was obvious that he wasn’t ready for one.  A lot of disregard for the care of it, playing games all day on it (not the reason I bought it), and not using it to call me when he was away from me.  I switched his device over to a watch, then eventually gave him the phone back by age 11.  I had strict restrictions on it, he could only use it for 1-3hrs give or take a day. That included limited text, His internet is blocked aside from school websites, games have a time limit, and calls are restricted to only me and my gf when it’s “downtime.”  A month Or two ago all of the restrictions came off aside from the blockage of internet.  I don’t know how exactly it came off but I kinda left it be because I thought maybe the kid needs more time to talk and text people during this isolated year.  He never had a close friend so he was never demanding or eager to get more phone time really, he just accepted the rules and abided by them without complaining.  When covid started I allowed him to play video games & I had never allowed that in the past.  When he was younger like 5/6 his baby sitter used to let him play but it was against my rules and it was never at home.  Around august he lost his privileges to that by playing when I had told him it was not allowed.  So he played for about 4 months straight.  As most of us know, the pandemic has our kids doing school online.  He already spends 6-9hrs on the computer a day for school and studying so I feel he doesn’t really to stare at a screen much longer anyway.  A couple months ago I caught him looking up girls on YouTube so I blocked inappropriate sites but I noticed that he goes on incognito and does things on the computer anyway.  I know it’s normal. I told him it wasn’t appropriate and I do not like that happening on My computer.  I do let him watch tv.  Him and I watch a movie together multiple nights a week and sometimes he watches it on his own tv shows on his own without me.  He also has adhd so the doctor told me in general to limit his screen time, just to add that in here.  Anyways, if your wondering what does he do for fun or in his spare time, he’s a very active kid and physical activity takes up most of his time.  He used to be on a hockey team but that has fallen short, so now we go to open skate 4x a week.  He does an exercise routine twice a day, he takes times in his day to read, does his chores, plays with legos, and practices piano or guitar. Sometimes he will watch tv and be on the phone, or we’ll watch tv together or he’ll help me cook. At night I have him put his phone on the kitchen table near mY room.  —anyways, I recently noticed that he’s been on his phone during school, and that he’s been sneaking it in his bed every night. I walked in his room and decided to take it away. I decided he was grounded.  I honestly don’t want to give it back to him because the reason I gave it in the first place was so he could contact me when we’re not together.  We’re always together now, he doesn’t go anywhere, I barely do either.  My views are that many kids are addicted to the internet and I just don’t want my kids getting sucked into the into it all.  My question here is- am I a bitch for wanting to limit this so much and for taking the phone away? I want to only give it back to him when he goes back to school in person. I know he can still see his friends during school hours so I just don’t care anymore.  He can also see friends at open skate and his cousin comes over every other weekend. I don’t mind taking him outside more. I’m just wondering- does ANYONE else limit their kids screen time or take away the phone? Or not even give the 12 yr old the phone at all? Amongst my friends with kids- I’m the only one! Why??? Is it that uncommon??? Am I a bad mom?!"

Parenting,technology,ye5imb,How to cope with being apart from my toddler for a couple of months?,"Hi all,

For circunstances we cannot avoid, I will be separated from my 2 year old daughter for a couple of months, we think maybe 5 or more months, even a year depending on our (bad) luck.

The only way I will be able to communicate with her would be video calls as we will be thousands of kilometers away as well as several timezones apart.

When she was a baby, she was hooked to her mother almost all the time, they obviously bonded inmediatly over breastfiding, while I was only the ""funny diaper changing man"", but as she started growing up, our bond started growing and growing to that sweet point which can only make you stupidly happy and in love with your kid...

She actively looks for me, asks my wife to call me to the office all the time, and everytime I get home from work she has the biggest smile and just dashes towards the door to give me a big hug and tell me all about her day... mommy stops existing for a couple of hours while she asks me to go sit with her on her room and play toghether, this makes me so incredibly happy

&#x200B;

For me and my wife, being apart a couple of months, while not easy, will be something we can cope with, we can understand. 

Our kid, on the other hand, she is so small, and although quite intelligent, won't understand adult reasons, I tell her everyday about this thing that is going to happen, that daddy won't abandon her, but rather that we will be separated because we need to sort out other stuff, but sooner than later, we'll be toghether again.

But still, I cry a lot when playing toghether. I see how much she's grown up and cry a little more when I think about the growth I will miss on this time, one of the most important moments of a kid life. I cry when thinking that maybe our relationship will go back to square one, and that she will see me again as a ""funny diaper changing man"" or resent me for ""abandoning her"".

Most people tell me that I am overreacting, that specially with technology it shouldn't be an issue as we can be on constant contact, and that she is so small she won't even remember or notice, that I should not worry too much and take this as a vacation where I can sleep again as when I was single, that such a small time apart won't change anything as they develop so fast, and a long etc. of things.

Maybe all the stress and anxiety of the situation we are living now is making me oversensitive about certain things and making a huge deal of something that shouldn't be, and as I am typing this, I see that a little bit of my history of depresion might be surfacing which I should definitively not dismiss.

Parenting,technology,fbjajg,Are we being too strict with technology?,"We are generally pretty strict with technology for our 7 and 3 year old sons. We believe that too much screen time is harmful for kids, and, having heard all the nightmares about kids getting addicted to screens, we are very careful to avoid screen time. The only regular screen time they get is family movie night every couple weeks. They share a tablet, but it is only used on road trips or in waiting rooms, and even then, we encourage them to bring toys and books instead. However, it recently occurred to me that we may be making them unrelatable to their peers by being so strict with screen time. Kids these days are always on Youtube or playing video games, and while we don't want to give them too much exposure to screens, we don't want them to be known as the weird Amish kids who can't relate to their peers. What do you think of this? There has got to be a happy medium somewhere."
Parenting,technology,llcizq,Toddlers & Technology,"My daughter is 3 and basically I try to go slow on her with technology. She does watches tv frequently, but I really do my best to have her use her inmagination to play with her toys and do other stuff that doesn’t include screen time. I understand we are in the new era where everything revolves around technology. But I just want her to enjoy the real important moments in life. She will definitely have a whole life to use the internet for her own advantage. Her dad and I disagree on this, he says I can raise her however I want to, but I have to keep in mind that this is a new era, I have to introduce her more to technology. I don’t know how some people are blind to not see that too much technology can separate kids from reality and disconnect with parents. The other day I was at the laundry with my daughter and there was a kid with a tablet that just wanted to watch cartoons ignoring everything else. My daughter on the other hand, wanted to just play. Again, my daughter watches lots of great cartoons that are appropriate and beneficial for us. I just believe that everything should be balance and age accordingly. There is absolutely nothing more important that connecting with your kids and making great memories together. Someone tell me your point of view?"

The local school district has changed the policies on what age can enroll into TK. Long story short, she can’t enroll until 5.

I would love to see her being active with other kids her age. Not being glued to technology. 

She’s amazing at call and response type interaction. For example, if I yell “D’oh!” She will yell it back louder and more enthusiasm.

Parenting,technology,u4g9zp,Advice on how to deal with 13 year old son who is stealing,"Note: This has also been partially posted on another thread (AITA).

My son (13m) has repeatedly stolen from us over the past two years. Each time he has denied it, even when we have found proof it was him. Last year he took my husband's (m48) bank card, added it to his google account on an old phone, and then spent $300 over a number of days, on a downloaded basketball game. We saw the transactions, stopped the card and then tracked it down by accident when we found him on the old phone, did a search of his google account, and found the card linked to it. He completely denied it was him and blamed his younger brother (m10). His brother has his own phone and never uses his older brothers. There were consequences - we grounded him and took the old phone off him. The new phone is on Google Family Link so we have a lock to prevent him buying anything without permission.

Yesterday we discovered that someone had made two payments on my husband's credit card - one payment for a laptop for $2000, which was declined, and the other for a bike for $3,000, which went through. We spoke to the credit card company and they refused to refund the money as we had been to the bike store before and used the card there, so they did not believe that the purchase was unauthorised.   There were also some incidentals at a local sweet shop - all under $10 each.

We went to the bike store where someone had spent $3,000 and they agreed to refund the money, minus the admin fee they get charged for refunds. They told us the order was placed online and printed the order for it and gave it to us. They said that it was a click and collect order. It had my husbands name on it, but my son's email address and telephone number. They said that they phoned the number after the order was made yesterday and spoke to the person who placed the order. They said that the person was clearly a child and was unhappy when they said that the card holder had to be present when the bike was collected. 

Incidentally, the store where the laptop purchase was attempted, is a 5 minute ride from the bike shop, so we suspect that whomever placed the order was going to go for the bike first, and then collect the laptop afterwards.

We checked my son's email and there was no evidence of an order being placed, but there was evidence on his call log of a 2 minute call with the bike shop the day before. We also found an email from the computer shop in his email and when we clicked on the account information, it opened in his safari and had his username and password saved. When we went into the account, the $2,000 computer was in the basket.

Due to one of the activities he participates in, he would have had a secure area to store the bike away from home, so we would not have known that he had it, if he had been able to collect it without ID.

Despite all the evidence against him, he has blamed his younger brother. His younger brother was on my laptop, in the lounge with me when the two incidents happened, so we know it was not him. My youngest also has no interest in riding or gaming.  He is only interested in playing on minecraft on his iPad with his best mate.

My husband had left his wallet out, and the card was still there, so we know the card has not been dropped/stolen. My eldest swears blind it was not him.

This is a significant amount of money, that we cannot afford and we are very lucky to have got most of it back. For context, he has a MacBook (required for school) and it was a gaming laptop he was attempting to buy.  He has a decent BMX bike and we have bought him a road bike (with the help of his grandparents) for his 13th birthday, which is in a few weeks time.  He is a triathlete, so this was to help him with training.  The bike he attempted to buy was a dual suspension mountain bike (we do not live near the mountains but he goes to a local bike park with his bmx).   He has previously asked for one of these bikes and we have explained to him that we cannot afford that sort of money.  We've told him he can save for it.  He gets pocket money and also, occasionally, acts as a ball boy at hockey matches, for which he gets paid $10 per game (we have encouraged this as it helps him learn about earning his own money).  He also gets given money by relatives for birthday and Christmas.

I just do not know what to do about him.   He acts completely innocent when we have talked to him about it (as he did on previous occasions).  He says he does not care what we do as he is innocent and did not do it.  He does have ADHD, is under a paediatrician and takes medication on school days, to control his impulsivity.  However, it is his complete denial of the situation, even when all the evidence points to it being him, that has thrown us.  He repeatedly blames his younger brother and refuses to accept that it was anything to do with him.  We do not believe it is his younger brother, who was on my laptop the entire time.  My eldest has his phone on him all the time, so we know it was him who answered the call.

I don't know what to do.  We've always focused on the difference between right and wrong.  We have used groundings and removal of technology as punishments in the past.  I generally have a good relationship with him and he will talk to me about things that are worrying or upsetting him.  Our relatives are overseas so we can't ask an elder relative to talk to him.

Any advice as to what to do here would be very much appreciated."
Parenting,technology,ts65l9,Advice on devices,"My kid is 1.5 years old and I’m just curious how much the tv and the tablet will affect or is affecting her behaviors. Do you guys have any studies i can read or books that study this stuff? I understand the technology being used by kids is fairly recent in the last 10-15 years. My wife and i are not sure how much screen time is too much. Ill play with her in the morning but when we eat ill usually put on some kids show and eat/watch with her. If i need to get things done after a nap i might leave her in bed and let her watch a movie on the tablet, while i straighten up or whatever. If were on a long car ride shell get a movie, or at a resturaunt, if she starts getting fussy and wants to walk around we’ll pull out the tablet as well. I hate that we do it in restaurants, but she’s not quite old enough to color or draw or read. Tips are appreciated."
Parenting,technology,invuo1,Technology meltdowns,"Well here I (35 f) am again. (TL:DR at the end) The last time I posted here it was during lockdown and I had had a major conflict with my eldest son (now 14) over a curfew on technology. I let the curfew slide over the summer as we were out of all routines and there were lots of sleepovers and meet ups with friends.

School is now back in full swing in our country so I had warned my son that we will be back to curfews on technology. He instantly went into a full blown meltdown. He spent an hour screaming and crying. He threw chairs around the kitchen and slammed doors. He called me a bitch and a cunt. My son is 5'11"" and athletic so this was an extremely volatile situation. 

What concerned me the most was that throughout the whole episode he kept saying how this will ruin his life and his whole year. That I didn't understand that he was involved in something deep. He said it isn't bad but he still can't tell me about it. I asked if we could talk about it with out naming anybody and find a way to work around whatever this important issue was while still adhering to the curfew. But all I got was that I was stupid and don't understand.

He has lost the privilege of using his phone for the next few days and I gave him 5 minutes to let whoever's is involved in the ""something deep"" that he won't be online for a few days. He chose to carry on the screaming and crying for those 5 minutes. I don't want to invade his privacy but I am worried that he has become too emotionally attached and dependent on his phone. I don't want to cut him off from his friends but I also know that he lacks the maturity to make good choices and regulate himself.

Any insights would be most welcome. I feel completely overwhelmed by my teenagers.

TL:DR  Son had a major meltdown when technology curfews were reinstated. Says he is involved in something deep on his phone but won't share any details. I am worried he is too emotionally attached to his phone and social media."
Parenting,technology,ls77ci,Technology and kids,"When I was a child I remember having free rein for do whatever I wanted with technology. 

I had a TV in my bedroom. (For as long as I remember)
Family computer with unlimited access until I got my own in 5th grade.
Ipod/mp3 players. (First iPod in 1st grade) 
Unlimited access to the Xbox or n64. 
A track flip phone in 6th grade. 

Additionally my parents never really stuck with the whole bedtime thing once I was about 8. 

Topically I would go through little phases where I would play the crap out of something until I got bored and moved on. 

I have 2 boys 2 and 9. And I have always been strict on technology because of the bad behavior that I get when it's taken away. 

My question is, if I gave the older one free rein say on his tablet,  do you think he would be less upset when it was taken away and be less obsessed with wanting to play on it constantly? 

I think I would play on it a lot at first but then the excitement would die off a little."

Parenting,technology,x0sfwo,LF resources? YouTube or podcast episodes about how to effectively use goals.,"My kid (7) is dying to to play Pokémon Go. I am against them having screens besides occasional tv. So no phones or tablets at the moment. I am against this thinking kids use those tools incorrectly and unproductively. Kind of like the way us adults do. I’d be all for if they were reading  and learning about all sorts of subjects and ideas. Learning to digitally draw or how to even programs computers,but of course ,they’d rather use these technological tools for time wasters Such as games and funny videos. (Tiktok will never enter my home)  
So my question is, whenever I have the upper hand, the carrot per se,what is the effective way to use it? To get long term change and positivity in a child. I know in the summer I challenged my daughter to read 30 chapter books in order to get one special Pokémon card. She did so, but once the reward was given it didn’t really create lasting change.  So what do smart people say about this, how should a parent use a child’s “want” effectively. I know that if i set the bar to low she’ll get to it easily, and honestly can’t think of higher bars to set, she’s already a pretty good kid.  Any conversational resources about this would help me greatly. Thank you!"
Parenting,technology,xroeob,Rambling of a confused stay-at-home mom,"Prepare for my whole life's story! warning this may get long and is probably really off topic. Tl;dr at the bottom.

I am 32F SAHM of 2 boys ages 5 and 2 in the US. Our family is complete and we are done having kids. For the last year, I have been feeling this overwhelming itch to be doing something (tm). Something to better myself. Further myself. I just cannot figure out what that is and I am feeling very stuck. My oldest started full time preschool and my youngest will be there in a few short years so I'm feeling like now is the time to prepare myself to go back to work at least part time. 

I have a bachelor's degree in animal science and a minor in biology. I graduated college in 2012 and started a graduate program for animal reproductive physiology. I took 1 semester of grad school and dropped out because I was just really burnt out. 

I have been working in veterinary clinics since I was old enough to get my first job. I held 2 non-veterinary field jobs in college but always found my way back to the clinic. I started as a kennel tech and worked my way up from there. I left the field in 2017 just before my first was born. 

Now, I want to do something. I'm considering going back to school but I'm stuck on a course forward. I am done working with animals. I enjoy animals still but I dont have the same animal centered calling as before. I don't know if it's the fact that I am pouring every last drop of care and empathy I have into my kids and there's not room anymore for me to care for animals in the same way or if I'm just burnt out on the industry. I still really love the medical side and science side of it. I also have great customer service skills and customers typically like me and respond well to me. I think I want to make the switch to human medicine but not in a direct patient care way. 

So, I've been looking into a program to get my associates in (human) health information technology to eventually become a medical coder or related job but, for some reason, that feels to me like I'm going backwards. I already have a bachelor's degree, I'm having trouble making it make sense in my brain to be going after a ""lesser"" degree for lack of a better word. But on the other hand, I'd be learning a skill with an intended job at the end (which is what I wish I  would've done when I went to college the first time), I could do the program mostly online and at a part time pace so I could still fulfill my SAHM responsibilities, there's the potential for a job in this field to work remote which would be great, and it still has that medical science aspect. Do I have a passion for medical billing and coding? Not really, does anyone? I mean I think I could be really good at it anyways, but what if I hate it? 

The other options might be to go back to grad school for something. Or start over with another bachelor's degree in something (yikes). Both would probably require a time commitment I just can't manage right now or anytime in the near future. Not to mention massive student loan debt I've already paid off once before and I've already made the mistake of getting a degree in something with no clear end job. 

So, fellow parents of reddit, what do I do with the rest of my life? Where do I go? What career options do I have? Who am I? Whats my name? Where am I going? I need all the ideas, help, advice, career counseling and probably regular counseling lol. 

Ps: i know someone is going to ask about my husband. We've been together 14 years and he is extremely supportive and says he will support whatever i want to do. Which in a way isnt helpful in giving me a direction lol. He works very hard, long and varied hours so that we are finacially comfortable. He's willing to pick up the home slack as much as he can and pay for me to go back to school. But his currently, well paying job will, of course, have to take precedent so we can eat. We had an agreement before we had kids that I would be responsible for the majority of the day-to-day home and child operations so he can work the hours required for us to live and for me to stay home to raise our boys. He is an amazing husband, very involved father and supports us well. I have to fulfill my end of that bargain. 

tl;dr: I can't decide what to do with my life and it's driving me crazy. I have a degree and used to work in animal medicine but i dont like animals anymore and want to switch to human medicine but not in direct patient care. Considering an associates degree in a technical skill but struggling with feeling like that's ""lesser"" than my bachelor's degree I already have. My brain is scrambled and I need help."
Parenting,technology,ty242q,English Teacher to Parents - go to board meetings and raise hell,"All over the country, and in my “great” state of Texas (who asininely thinks they have education down pat) school boards are making decisions that harm your children’s education because of assumptions based in fallacy.

No longer do most schools teach:
-spelling
-grammar
-mechanics
-sentence structure
-typing

And a whole host of the most foundational skills that your children need to succeed in schools. 

The justification is that standardized tests are the crux on which much funding rests so there is no time. The excuses are that these things will just “rub off” on students as they read books, which, by default, have good and proper spelling, grammar, mechanics, sentence structure, etc. Typing isn’t taught because schools think that since your children grow up in the age of technology that they will have that skill by default when they need it. Nope. Texting is not typing.

Because of this, your students come to school unprepared for the basics of education. Time is spent in my 9th grade classroom teaching basic skills and not analysis or rhetoric and the consequence is that students are falling further behind. 

High level students regress because they are in classrooms with students without basic skills, and since teachers need to think of the group, high level students are being re-taught things they’ve mastered long ago.

Low level students are passed along without actually earning their grades purely because administration wants to save face and “look good” to higher ups.

In addition, teachers are tasked with menial responsibilities that take away time from teaching your children. Know that a barrier put in front of a teacher is a barrier out in front of a student. 

I’m not complaining about pay. I’m worried about your children and my students. 

Admin calls us experts in our fields but doesn’t listen when we raise our concerns but will fold like origami whenever a parent asks a question. I implore you: go to board meetings. Speak up for your children. Force them to change practices and educate students, not just graduate them.

Your child graduating high school should not be the highlight of their life. They could accomplish so much more if your school boards would enact significant change that allows it to be so.

Help us. Please."
Parenting,technology,ixddcc,Need some technology help.,"So, my 10 year old son has a cell phone my mother in law purchased him about six months ago. Originally my wife and I were strongly against it. Our rule was ""if your old enough to be alone, then you can have a phone"". Unfortunately the covid pandemic has changed things, and where I live school is strictly from home. So we gave in and let him have the phone so he can have some semblance of interaction with other children other than his two year old sister, whom is absolutely too much to handle 80% of the time. The problem is this phone was set up by his grandparents under thier email, and they let him purchase all kinds of unnecessary apps. He can also go to whichever websites he pleases. We do monitor his phone time, but with the two year old we cant always look over his shoulder. I picked up his phone one day and his phone was filled with popups in his notifications about naughty singles in his area and all kinds of other spam garbage. So naturally I took the phone away and factory reset it. I cant seem to find a good app or anything to keep him from absent mindedly downloaded something unintended or that hes too young to see. I also dont want to look like the bad guy by making it so he can no longer video chat with friends and family. My wife and I are very concerned about covid after my wife lost two of her friends to the disease. So many of the people he uses the phone to speak with are family members and friends he can hardly see in person. Any advice I'll take into consideration. Thanks!

Parenting,technology,x9mnoi,Struggling to parent step-kids when they are resentful of chores and responsibilities,"I’m a widow (41) so my kids (17, 14, 12) don’t have a living father. My husband (44)  kids (ages 14, 11) live with us most of the time (along with my kids) and go to their mom’s every other weekend. We have a chore chart and every kid has a day of laundry and a day that they poop scoop (not strictly monitored, tbh). There are 5 weekly chores that rotate through kids on a weekly basis: clean kids bathroom, help with the dinner, dishes, run robovacuum/help lawn mow, trash/pool maintenance. They also have things on their chart like: brush teeth/shower, pick up items from common living areas, and pick up towels/dirty clothes from shared bathroom. 

I always help with dinner/dishes and my husband always helps with pool/lawn. They don’t have to do the weekly chores every day (just once and maintain) and we are understanding if one has an athletic event or church youth group that means that they need help (mainly for dinner or dishes). 

The youngest, Brian (not real name), has expressed to the oldest that he doesn’t think it’s fair. He thinks kids shouldn’t have to do chores. He doesn’t have chores at his mom’s house and thinks that kids should be kids. Another source of contention is that (to varying age levels) each kid has a certain amount of screen time (3 hours per day). And they can’t hop on video games or TV until they have been cleared with chores. 

Brian has been sneaking electronics and watching YouTube without having done chores. I’ve sensed that my husband is resentful when I get on to him because I admit that I have said, “If you check things off of your chart that you haven’t done. You are lying.” And Brian has been busted for this or making excuses several times. He has been grounded, but he has cheated his way around things (using google to watch videos before we get home/ sneaking his phone into the bathroom) when he knows he is not supposed to. 

I’ve recently said that I am not going to hold his kids accountable for chores (just mine) because I think that they don’t see the value in knowing the skills and working hard. But it actually kills me that I want them to learn these skills and I don’t think they have the same values.

I feel like my husband and I have the same values, but I literally can’t sleep if the kids aren’t on board and he doesn’t see the sense in addressing it if it no one is upset. 

I literally don’t know if I am asking for advice on how to not care or if there is another way to get him on board with seeing the values of talking to them about why this is important. I’m also worried that their mom is reinforcing negative behaviors to get them to see her house as more fun so that they will want to stay with her more (they have unlimited video games, phone, TV, apps access, and no chores/homework/responsibilities). She admits that they are on all night sometimes. I want them to have fun when they go to their mom’s but I don’t want them to to think that love is about money or technology access and not time invested in a person or helping other people. We don’t ask for financial support from their mom, but we do ask that she communicates with us. And she upholds her end of the bargain, but she doesn’t hold to our consequences or expectations at her house.

I just don’t know how to step-mom through this."
Parenting,technology,b0gtjv,"Parents of teenage children (mine is 13F) How do you deal with your child being a technology junkie and not wanting to do anything else or listen to anything you say? I'm trying to instill some values without being too controlling, but nothing is working.","I love my daughter and we have a pretty good relationship/friendship compared to some I see. However, she frustrates me endless. For example I've explained a number of times that she needs a balanced lunch for school. If I'm not there to supervise, she'll just take crap to school. How hard is it to make a sandwich? How hard is it to make and eat breakfast? 

Sometimes I have to go out to work at night, but I'll be back before midnight. She knows the deal, bedtime by 10 (I've explained the importance of sleep and being well rested for school). Last night I caught her being awake at 11 pm, her lunch wasn't made. 

These are just two small examples but they're as a result of her putting all her time into the internet. If she wasn't on it, she would make her lunch and go to sleep early. God forbid, maybe even read a book, or take the dog for a walk. In the past she had interests in art, drama, reading, sports. Now all she wants to do is sit on the net, doing mindless crap like browsing Instagram and TikToc. I've explained that she needs to have hobbies, that the internet is numbing her brain, that she has talents she shouldn't let slip. In one ear, out the next. I want her to self regulate, I'm sick of explaining, pleading, nagging. I've tried putting limits on the amount of time she's allowed on the internet, but we always slip back. I now also have to take into account that she's communicating with her friends on there, and I don't want to stop that. 

I'm a single mum, and I'm just fed up. I'm worried about her wasting her talents and her life (as I've done). I'm fed up repeating myself and I feel like bailing out. By that I mean sending her half the time to her loser father who lives in a bungalow and never has any money, and spends no time trying to guide her to become her better self. I provide well for her, but I figure if none of my effort sticks, why am I wasting my time? It eats up so much of my energy. Am I overreacting? Should I just let her do whatever? Take shit for lunch, go to bed late, waste her life on the internet? Is this just a phase and she'll start to care more? Develop some interests? Am I overreacting? Anybody with similar experiences out there? What do you do? 

EDIT: Thank you to everybody who bothered to comment, I really appreciate it 🙂

I was actually thinking about going to see a counsellor about it, but Reddit became my counsellor haha.

It was great to hear from different people, from adults who were the same when they were young and came out the other side fine, to parents who have worked out how to balance it all out. 

Overall, I will not sweat the small stuff, and implement the strategies that were suggested (which I've replied to individually)

Thanks again 🙂"

Parenting,technology,tesgb0,Lost on how to parent my teens,"I have a 15 year old boy and 14 year old girl (experimenting with non-binary identity). I am a teacher and have been very successful with other peoples middle school aged kids.  With my own, I’m at a loss. My son is failing classes - no amount of encouragement or punishment will help him care enough to do the work and I won’t make excuses for him or do it for him. He is athletic but not interested in doing organized sports. He has a girlfriend who he thinks hung the moon(and she’s a darling girl) but outside of her he is driven by nothing - which I don’t think is healthy. My 2nd kiddo has anxiety and bounces between A’s and F’s on a dime.  2nd child feels like they don’t fit in and battle feeling like everyone treats them differently. We have strong family routines - home cooked healthy meals, reasonable bedtimes, technology available but monitored and limits, we get outdoors, drive them to hang with and encourage hanging out with friends, as well as “forced family fun” where we go out together. Neither kid in involved with drugs (as far as we know - but I truly don’t think so)  I hate that my relationship with them has become a roller coaster of monitoring school work, fussing about getting things done and any kind of motivation.  I hate that I feel like I am constantly switching between cheerleader and drill Sargent.  I don’t know whether to crack down and take away everything until they prioritize and turn school and interactions at home around or let the natural consequences be punishment enough and focus on the cheerleader part.

Single mother of two children. Their father bought them iPads. In the last month I thought I was going crazy because I kept getting iTunes charges which resulted in 35 return check fees. 
Turns out my children were buying in game currency and subscribing to things from their iPads. Between the two of them and the returned check fees it’s a grand total of $2174. I haven’t gone Christmas shopping yet and we are road tripping to my mothers house in a week. This is almost half of my months pay! How would y’all handle this situation? I want the punishment to be memorable and for them to learn something along with just. One kids only spent $167 the other spent $1009 so in reality their punishments should somewhat be different. However they both lied when they were asked about buying stuff. 

For all of the forward thinkers:
I have removed all payment sources from their appleIDs. 
I have called the bank to dispute the returned check fees due to unauthorized transactions, they removed 4.
I have started the dispute for PayPal and emailed customer support for the programs they were buying for."
Parenting,technology,v0mywu,"Yup. I'm judging. Sorry, not sorry.","Out at a mall with my little one today. Grabbed a bite to eat in the food court and there were two little girls eating, both with their own tablet watching the same movie! Their parents were sitting too, glued to their phones. As me and my little one were sitting and eating, there was another Mom with her tween. The girl had stood up and was trying to talk to her mom, touching her arm and trying to talk to her. She would not look up from her phone to acknowledge her daughter. I could clearly see her phone and she was legit just scrolling Instagram so I don't want to hear any B.S. about how some people need to be on their phones for work. A few months back, we were at swimming lessons and there was a mother and son. She had her phone with headphones in and her son had a tablet with his own headphones standing in the middle of the pool area (big pool is separated from hot tub by a large walkway and I'm assuming there was a sibling at a lesson) for the entire swimming lesson!

I cannot stand it anymore. Are we so fucking addicted to technology we can't even head to the mall without tablets for BOTH children?!?! You can't sit and have fucking lunch with your goddamn child because insta has more to offer? These moments with them are fleeting, talk to your kids!! People watch, anything else! I have never once left the house with my daughters tablet to distract her on an outing. I don't even give her my phone at the table. They are little humans that need human engagement.

Parenting,technology,shtz78,How do I explain to a caregiver not to do something?,"I have a mental dilemma. I'm soon to go back to work after maternity. My partner is a teacher so can't do alternating shifts. As we all know childcare is expensive. So my aunt has offered to look after my son when she is off, she works odd shifts, and I'm very grateful. 

She is very good with him however I have one big issue with her looking after him: when he cries, she shows him videos on her phone. He is 6 months old. He is also starting to make associations. A: I don't want him to think that phones are for anything other than taking photos, face time or phonecalls and B: he will start assuming that if he cries then he will get shown videos. I have seen how this can spiral very quickly. He is a very happy child, he only is ever fussy when he's hungry or tired...

My issue is how do I approach this? Her thing is ""well it won't kill him"". No it won't but my partner and I don't want him to view phones and tablets as a source of entertainment, so that he has a healthy relationship with technology. It's the one rule we will stand strongly by, how do I feel confident that she'll follow that?"
Parenting,technology,ri1a45,For parents gifting phones or tablets this holiday season. Understand parental controls.,"I lost $16k USD in approximately 8 days, because my child played Monster Legends on an Apple iPad. 

I am posting a copy of recommendations that I have come up with to help you avoid my fate.

Long story short, exposure to technology is great for kids, but for those of you buying or gifting iOS or Android devices to minors this holiday season, here are some words of advice:

If you use Family Sharing with Apple, you will be forced to put payment information on the primary device. So either do not use Family Sharing with minors, or follow some of the advice below.

Also, with family sharing, and the delays that often exist between a purchase and Apple sending receipts to you, or charges to your payment method, if you have valid purchases on one device, and unauthorized purchases on another, they will often get bundled together on receipts and charges. This makes disputing the charges more difficult, because the bank cannot see the number of purchases that make up a single charge.

* Make sure that all parental controls are enabled. If you make a mistake, and your child purchases game content on the tablet, both Apple and PayPal will likely consider that authorized activity.

* Apple makes the process of approving purchases difficult, once those controls are on, and you may have to disable them to purchase anything for your child. DO NOT FORGET TO RE-ENABLE THE CONTROLS. 

* If you upgrade a device that had controls enabled, do not assume that they will be enabled if you are restoring the device from backup.

* There are forms on Apple’s site to report unauthorized purchases by a minor; but, most in-app purchases will not be considered refundable. And, Apple will provide you no information on why a refund was approved or disallowed. You can appeal a denial, but you will likely just get another denial a day or two later, with no detail.

* Set up a small dollar credit card to direct all purchases to. If there are unauthorized purchases, you do not want to use a high limit credit card, or worse, a bank account through PayPal. 

* Apple and PayPal provide no abnormal activity warnings. You will get receipts from Apple and PayPal, but again, it is unlikely that you will get a refund. 

* Based on similar stories I have seen online, Apple puts the responsibility on you to stop the purchases before they get excessive; so do not filter Apple or PayPal receipts in your email. Make sure you get active alerts for any purchases or receipts.

* It is also likely that if you are using a bank account with PayPal, your bank will not provide any abnormal activity protection either.

* Worse, if you use a PayPal account and have multiple funding sources, PayPal will automatically fall over to the second source, if you are using a credit card which does detect abnormal activity, and your primary source rejects the payment. So, they will continue to drain your accounts dry.

My recommendation is to avoid using PayPal for device purchases at all costs. It provides no protection for you, other than hiding your credit card number, and like Apple, they provide no detail if they reject your claim. At least in my case, it does not matter how quickly you identify the purchases. Once they are made, you have no recourse.

Unfortunately, it seems that purchases through PayPal that fall back to a bank account also lose protection that you may have with a credit card, so again, the bank will likely deny your claim.

I assume Google Play is similar, but I have not used it.

Remember, as far as Apple, PayPal and the Monster Legends developers are concerned: any activity that occurs on a device you own is authorized. Side note: Roblox developers do support refunds, which is much appreciated.

Don’t run into a ruined holiday season and upcoming child’s birthday like my family is now going to have because of a simple mistake in configuring your device.

AMA about how to protect your account, and based on my experience I will try to provide guidance. 

I am posting under an alt, because I am embarrassed, and depressed, and now have to explain to a child why his birthday and Christmas are ruined. Don’t be me."
Parenting,technology,8wkir8,My 17 year old son (and his mates) and have become extremely anti-technology and I don't know if this is cause for concern or just an odd fad,"My son is 17, since he was much younger he's been sort of ""old fashioned,"" he liked to listen to old music on records, loved watching old movies, never liked going on Facebook or playing video games etc. and that was never something that my husband and I saw as a problem. However it's gone beyond just that sort of thing lately, he's become quite adamantly anti-technology/modern things, won't use a computer or a phone or watch any of the television programmes or movies that he used to love, he calls all sorts of modern culture from music to the styles that people dress in ""disgusting rubbish"", he's falling behind in school because he won't do a lot of the work that requires he use the computer, and he got in big trouble when his teacher told him that his writing has to be submitted electronically so that it can be put through a programme to check for plagiarism and he called her ""a lazy, useless bitch who has a machine do her job for her."" 

He used to want to be a lawyer, now when he grows up he tells me that he wants to live off the lands. I don't really talk to his mates' parents but I think that this is something that they're going through together, because they like to do survivalist type things like go into the woods and make fires with sticks and whatnot. I don't even know if this is something that I should be concerned about, aside from the rudeness to his teacher, as so many parents would love for their teenagers to be less into technology, but to me it's just bizarre how he and his mates are basically rejecting the whole world and wanting to live in the woods. Is this a trend or something?"
Parenting,technology,viczwa,Help for the “non-problem child”,"I have two kids, 11f and 6f. My youngest is what every second child meme is about. We are having her assessed by a mental health professional in August as she struggles with angry outbursts and other behavior problems. 

That said, the problem I have is explaining this to my oldest without making excuses.  She is a great kid, and she is feeling like my husband and I let the youngest get away with things that she would not have. And, in complete honesty, she’s not wrong. I strongly suspect my youngest has ADHD or mild autism, not to mention a spinal deformity that she is having surgery for next month. She is 100% a harder kid, but I don’t want my oldest to feel slighted. I don’t want to foster a household of resentment because the youngest is treated different. We do try to be conscious of the fact that there are some differences in how they are treated, due to several factors such as changes in technology (even five years has made a difference), individual strengths and opportunities, and learnings as a parent. We try very hard to be fair, but fair and equal are not the same thing. 

Are there any resources anyone knows about that can help me help the “other kid?”  I can’t have the same standard for my youngest that we had for our oldest as the youngest isn’t at the same bar. Not even when my oldest was six. I’m not sure what to do."

Parenting,technology,ib5tsx,Is my kid addicted to technology?,"I’m wondering if my kid could be addicted to technology. She’s 4 years old and I feel awful for saying this because of course it’s partially my fault. But lately we’ve been more lax with tv and devices, more so with devices and also audio books. My main worry is actually audiobooks. She asks to listen to one of her audiobooks to wake up in the morning, fall asleep, while she eats meals and snacks, and any other time of the day she isn’t devoting 100% attention to something else. She cannot fall asleep without listening to an audiobook or something like Moshi, and is grumpy in the morning until she gets to listen to her books (she wakes up early and it’s easy to give in when we want to sleep until 6:30 or 7) Tonight Putting her to bed I just wanted to talk about her day and we started talking for a minute or two and then she said she was getting bored and wanted to listen to her cd book. I remember listening to books to fall asleep but not every day and definitely not at every meal and to help me wake up in the morning and multiple other times during the day. It’s a bad habit that I and especially my husband use and give into often. 

We limit movies to one a day or a few shows and sometimes nothing if we’re busy. My husband usually gives her his phone or the iPad a few times a day while he’s working and I’m nursing our baby. I worry that when she’s old enough to go to school she’ll have no attention to listen to a teacher. She was in preschool for only a few months before COVID started. 

We started audiobooks when she was between 18 months to 2 years and sleeping in a toddler bed to help her fall asleep in her room on her own and it worked so we kept doing it. 

I’d love either some reassurance that this won’t last forever but I’m pretty sure it will only get worse, since it’s only been getting worse the past few months. So also advice on how to curb this would be really appreciated. Any advice is welcome!"

Google Home App - Account photo - Assistant Settings - Family Bell - add bell!

We use it for prompting bathroom breaks, preparing for Zooms for school, snack time, clean up time, bedtime routine.  It's been so great since ""Google"" says it, it's a computer saying it's chore time, not mom or dad!  A few less fights during the day with toddlers has been game changing!

Parenting,technology,exbuyh,"7 year old, technology and failed parenting... help please!","Hi there. I’m quite embarrassed about this... but I’m going to jump right in. 

My mental health took a real nasty dive after leaving my abusive partner. My child suffers extreme anxiety, and as of the last 6 months, I’ve lost control. 

See, my 7 year old is now spending 80% of his day on his Nintendo switch, xbox or watching YouTube. He’d rather do this than go out or socialise with friends & family. Admittedly, I’ve allowed this to go on far too long. 

How do I get him off technology? (He has real bad tantrums when I try). I made a rod for my own back, I know that. 

But I’m not even sure what things I can do with him - money is so low that I can’t afford most things and I don’t drive. 

How can I encourage him gently to spend less time on the xbox and more time with me, friends and family? What free activities can we do together? He’s very reluctant to try anything new. 

I want to encourage us both to start leaving the house to go on nature walks etc. 

In general, he’s so loving and friendly. His behaviour isn’t affected *too* much, but I just know what he’d prefer to do. Sit on technology and escape the real world all day, every day. 
And it is having a negative affect on us both. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this."
Parenting,technology,voknny,increasing difficulties with stepson (11),"I have been with my fiancee for just over two years now. My stepson has become increasingly difficult when it comes to chores and just doing anything he gets asked to do. Examples are below


Doing dishes - argues for 10-20 minutes before finally doing them. But will do them poorly and leave food on them. Claiming that it's clean or he doesn't know how to do them. Leaving us to have to rinse or wash dishes when we need to do them.

Cleaning - if his chore is to vacuum or tidy his area he will either do the job very poorly or say he won't pick up something because he didn't put it there. He expects all of us especially his sister to do it for him. He always has an excuse as to why he can't do a task - can't put dishes away because she's In the way. Can't wash dishes because others are in his way of the cleaning. Don't know how to use the vacuum ect. 

Bedtimes- when off to bed will argue he's not tired to his mother and myself and that he still wants to watch TV. Or that he needs a drink of water, needs to go to the toilet ect. This can and has carried on till 11pm. 

Going to his grandmothers house - This is a big issue. The only ones he can really go to is his father or grandmothers house. She let's him get away with anything while there. He regularly tells us when there for a weekend that he only slept once or stayed up all night gaming before we pick him up. Making his attitude worse for days afterwards

Technology - Both his mother and I have noticed his attitude getting worse after we have let him use his phone for tiktok or xbox/switch for gaming. He immediately goes from calm to angry once we tell him time off and time for bed.

Answering for us - when his sister (10) asks my fiancee or myself a question he will immediately answer no to whatever she asks. Examples are: she will ask if we can go for a walk or have a drink and he will say no right away. 

Claiming we are lazy- My Fiancee is currently 32 weeks pregnant so we are on one income. I work between 40 and 50 hours a week and when he is asked to do something he will refer to me and say ""why can't he. He's just being lazy"" 

Those are just the few off the top of my head. My fiancee, my stepdaughter and myself are all at our wits end on how to deal with this. 

Thank you."

Parenting,children social media,ynf3ws,Parents of kids keeping their children off Social Media,"Question for parents who have decided to keep their children(s faces) off social media.
Do you include your private FB account with that, or is that public platforms only?

We’ve decided to not post their faces on public social media but I’m torn about our private FB. We know everyone we have on there, and have become selective about who we have as FB friends.
Do you post their faces on your private FB?

Why or why not.
Wondering what others do to help us decide"
Parenting,children social media,yryydr,Stop posting children that aren’t yours on social media!,"I’m not talking blurred lines, or never been outlined. I’m talking, *I* don’t post my child on social media, I’ve outlined I don’t and told others not to do so without my consent [my answer will always be no], so why am I seeing my child on a social media platform that doesn’t belong to ME? 

I don’t care if it’s a 1 second clip, a whole video, or just part of his face. If it is identifiable of my child… DO NOT post it. 

Why do people think these boundaries are flexible? 🙄"
Parenting,children social media,towpt8,Social Media + Mental Health in Children and Teens,"Edit: This post is me doing research on a product I would like to create that would provide some solutions to the below and what I find to be the downsides of giving children smartphones.  If you do not agree with how I view smart phones and how they cause depression etc., then I'd love to hear why. 

How many parents are aware of how young children are being exposed to pornography, sexual predators and bullying at younger and younger ages due to access on their smart phones?

If you could still hand them a smart phone so they do not get ostracized at school, yet completely control what they have access to and for how long, would you do that? Would it be overprotective or simply parenting? Suicides have been on the rise since COVID due to increased social media use, so if you could, would you want to control these things with little effort (i.e. pop ups on your own phone about their usage, etc)?

Edit: I distinctly recall COVID and increased suicides being news at the beginning of the pandemic, however looking it up again, the overall rate of suicides has declined, however the rate in certain demographics has increased. 

I am  not looking forward to the day I hand my kiddo a smartphone with all the dangers it poses, yet maybe I am overreacting due to a YouTube video I watched about it.  Curious to know what everyone's thoughts are since I have some ideas on a product that could help mitigate the issues."
Parenting,children social media,102cn7h,Do you think we’re going see a major shift in kids social media?,"My kids are both in their first years of school. I have noticed a huge amount of discussions about having a hard rule about 0 social media & social media phones. 

All parents vary in age, so I don’t think its generational of the parents. I grew up without smart phones and social media until we were college age & I feel bad for anyone who didn’t. 

Obviously, not happening in the near future but it seems the data and the overall vibe from others who have older kids is hard pass. 

Do you think this’ll be a change we see?"

I am a FTM expecting in March and cautious about oversharing baby development info/pics throughout their childhood as I want to protect their privacy as much as possible, but I also understand the convenience of such platforms for connectivity amongst family and friends. 

Everyone is entitled to their opinion on this, and I am just wanting to gain a better perspective from seasoned parents and other FTMs who may also be considering their plans for this. 

Thanks!"
Parenting,children social media,xxap9z,Teacher’s Inappropriate Social Media Use,"I’m desperate to get some advice. My daughter is a high schooler and has become “friends” with a male teacher in his 30s. Obviously when she told me that they were friends and that they were having personal conversations unrelated to school, the first thing I did was look him up on social media.

This man is creepy. He does nothing but sit on social media all day while at school, complaining about his job and thirstposting about 18-year-old models and in one case an actual 16-year-old (who is not his student and lives in a different country). 

I contacted the administration telling them that they need to keep this man away from my child and also that his social media use is out of line for a teacher. He responded to this by posting on his social media about how a crazy parent is “cyberstalking” him and trying to get him to lose his job, but that the administration knows I’m crazy and that they assured him he can’t get in trouble for his social media use. Then got right back to the creepy thirstposting.

That was WEEKS ago. I sent them a “hey, what the hell?” thinking they’d at least get him to cut it out, and he then went into detail on his social media about my daughter and family and how he thinks we’re bad parents, again saying that the administration is on his side. He didn’t include my daughter’s name but did include enough details that she would be identifiable.

Over a month now. The superintendent and school board are ignoring me and this guy’s continuing to post every day about how he’s horny for teenagers and how a crazy parent is out to get him.

I called the state department of education and they said they’d follow up with the school and recommended that I file a federal sexual harassment complaint and a CPS report, but I don’t think he has actually committed a crime or that his interactions with my kid actually constitute sexual harassment.  But it’s creepy and disturbing.

Does anyone have any idea what to do?"
Parenting,children social media,z3d5jj,I hate the stupid phone and social media,"I don't want to get my child the smart phone or let them have social media. I am deciding to get my kid an apple watch that can call and text but doesn't have a camera, social apps capabilities.

Is this a good route to go?  

To me the phone is the ""kiss of death"" for a child's confidence, innocence, attention span etc"
Parenting,children social media,wtm6nk,How to ask MIL to remove photos of my babies from her social media?,Deleted
Parenting,children social media,cu4zru,Posting babies/children on social media,"What are your philosophies on posting images of your children on social media? I am the mom of a 6 MO girl. I only use Instagram and post occasional photos of her there. I try to keep the posts positive and respectful. I ask myself “if someone posted a picture like this of me, would I be ok with it?” Increasingly though, I’m feeling that posting any images of her may violate her privacy and I want to avoid creating a digital footprint for her that could impact her in the future. 

On one hand, I see my SIL who posts literally every moment of her children’s lives (tantrums, blowouts, embarrassing moments, commentary on things she doesn’t like about them, etc.). I feel like this is an obvious inappropriate use of social media. She makes a mockery of their vulnerable moments to get attention and pity. Plus, it’s way to much even without the questionable nature of the content. 

Alternatively, I have a friend from college who I haven’t seen in a few years and literally had no idea she had even had a baby because she has never shared a single photo of her child or even of herself being pregnant. 

What are your thoughts? Do you think it’s bad to share photos? What rules do you have for yourself?"
Parenting,children social media,jzwqhm,My children’s father is using social media to say hurtful things about them.,"My children’s father is using social media to say hurtful things about them.
I posted this to r/relationship and it was removed because they are my children. 

I have two adult (26M), (24F) children with my first husband. In the last few months, he has started posting nasty things on social media that are directed at them. Some more obviously directed at them that others. 
He posted “your mother wanted you aborted”. He posted the year we got pregnant with our first child was when his life started going down the drain. He posted that anyone who goes to art school sucks dick (our oldest son is in a masters degree or program). When he was confronted with this information, he blocked the children and I on social media and posted that he was going to have to block all these pieces of shit and cunts because they were taking screenshots etc. of the things that he posted. He knew about the screenshots because my daughter called him out on it and told him that was absolutely wrong. 
The children feel he needs to be held accountable, but they are looking to me to help them understand why any parent would do this. His current wife dismissed it all with “that’s just how he is.”
Some background: he is 42, lies about being a college graduate, lies about living in a huge house overlooking the River (lives in a trailer in the middle of nowhere). He is chronically unemployed while his current wife works two jobs. He has always been a liar and seemingly out of touch with the reality of his own existence, but started this behavior when the children called him out over (public) homophobic and transphobic posts on social media. 
The cause of our divorce was extreme abuse, and I have not had contact with him since my youngest turned 18. I honestly hate the man, but this is sinking to a new low. 

What the hell is going on with this guy? How do I help my children accept that his behavior is not indicative of them as people and that he is 100% wrong for doing this?

TLDR: my children’s father makes gay remarks and calls them cunts on social media."
Parenting,children social media,wnn4op,Do you post pictures of your child publicly on social media?,"FTM, but I strongly am not going to do this and asking all family members to respect my wishes. Some have made snide remarks and sarcastic comments but in the end it’s my baby and I don’t want his face on the internet. 

“Do you think my friends are perverts? Why do you think everyone in the world is out to get you? Your baby will grow up to be just as paranoid as you!!”


No, I don’t think your “friends” are perverts but I also don’t know who they are and who has access to their profile. I think statistically the chances are low someone would want to do something bad with the photos but why even take the smallest chance? I’m here to protect him. He’s not going to grow up paranoid, he’s going to feel safe, protected, and not have animosity towards me for letting strangers have access to his photos.



I have been getting quite a bit of backlash for this decision. I was wondering others parents’ POV, thanks!

Parenting,children social media,idg2a9,Why are we reprimanding adult children on social media?,"As a personal example my grandfather shared a post that was victim shaming a woman who had been raped. I commented about how it was victim shaming and how consent is consent. My mom came at me and had a face to face conversation about how i was wrong to call out the post saying things like he just doesn't understand and saying I don't need to be mean to him. I didnt think I was mean i was stating only facts no opinions. 

Other examples I see. When mothers post pictures of their kids and grandmothers are always being judgmental about kid's clothes or the cleanliness of their house. When a opinion is shared by the child and their parent condemns them on social media about their opinion. 

I'm just confused about why? As a parent I've learned to pick my battles and that my opinion isn't always helpful or necessary. I then choose not to share but I see a lot of adults parents do these things. 

I'm not trying to start an argument but would really like to understand."
Parenting,children social media,z1hs4w,social media & disappointment about baby’s gender🥴,"is it ever appropriate for pregnant parents to share on their social media or blogs that they’ve been upset about their baby’s gender?

 this has always seemed super unacceptable and weird to me. i also know some people who think it’s legit and parents should be allowed to publicly share their gender disappointment. but what if baby reads the old social media post when they’re older and feels responsible for making their parents sad by being the “wrong” gender??

in general i think baby’s gender shouldn’t be a big deal at all, so i know i don’t see it from the popular point of view that comes into play here."
Parenting,children social media,zpad66,Invitations and requesting privacy from social media,"Hello,

I'm making the invites for a birthday party and was trying to figure out the wording to use to kindly request that they do not post photos of my child on social media. 

Originally, I had the social media icons and next to it 

>Privacy Please. NO Social Media.

I thought maybe I could give more detail, so I wouldn't get asked “why not”. So I changed it to the following.

>Respect children's privacy. NO Social Media.

Any thoughts or opinions? I don't want to sound aggressive or demanding. I guess the shorter version is probably better, in a less self-righteous kind of way.

Parenting,children social media,yqoqmf,Do you let your kids have social media?,"Hello. My wife and I have 4 kids (11, 9, 7, and 3). Our 11 year old will be entering middle school next year and we have decided to give her a phone number and lte internet when she does so she can contact us after extracurricular activities and what not. The older 3 already have phones that are basically just Wi-Fi tablets. We have it to where they have to put in a password only we know to download anything. They don’t have access to internet browsers or social media yet either. Should we let them have social media when they go to middle school? We just worry about them being introduced to cyber bullying and extremism at such a young age. We don’t want their self worth to take a hit either.

Social media will only grow and become more complex. I fear that by giving it up and letting it grow without me, I’ll be stuck trying to “parent blind” so to speak on the topic of social media.

My daughters, fathers, girlfriend, keeps posting photos of my daughter on public accounts. I’ve asked her to stop and she has not. Does anyone have any advice on this?

Parenting,children social media,8f0yqp,What are your thoughts on posting pictures of your children on social media?,"I personally have no photos of myself posted on any social media. I have a lot of reasons, it's mainly that I hate how I look in pictures - but a huge part of it is to do with privacy. I don't have any beef with people who choose to have their pictures online though, I respect their choice just as 99% of people I know respect mine. I do however have silent issue with parents who post naked or embarrassing photos/videos of their kids on Facebook, since when these kids are teenagers or at school or anything, this choice made by the parents could hurt the children. Then it also comes down to the question of whether a parents judgment of what is considered embarrassing is appropriate or not. 

We are having our first baby soon, and I don't feel comfortable putting any pictures of him online. I feel like it should be a decision he can make for himself when he is older and can understand what it means to have your picture online. At the same time though, I don't want to force my feelings about it onto him since I know my opinion is definitely a less common one, and perhaps it's considered weird by most. 

Friends and family members who are really important will have access to photos in other ways, so it's not an issue of depriving loved ones of pictures or updates. It's an issue of keeping out nosey coworkers and aquaintences who simply just don't need to know our families business, or people who could abuse pictures down the track.  

What are your thoughts and feelings on the matter? Do you post pictures of your children online? Why, why not? Do you let other people take photos of your kids with their personal devices? Where do you draw the line? "
Parenting,children social media,10nw55m,Advice needed about bullying in college,"My son was bullied in high school by three girls who began a rumor that he raped them. My son vehemently denied the rumor.  I spoke with the girls, who also denied that my son had ever been romantically or sexually involved with them. During covid, the rumor made its way around the internet, which led to my son being ""cancelled"" by almost all of his peers. Because of this rumor, my son has been threatened and physically assaulted, and my other children have been harassed at their schools.

We thought this would end when he entered college this year, but during his first week of university (in the same state), a mob of kids followed him back to his dorm and assaulted him. Luckily, the campus police had everything on camera and these students were fined and put on probation.

He now mainly stays in his dorm room. Recently, one of the girls transferred to this university and has again made it her mission to harass him online and in person. It's as if the girl now unequivocally believes the rumor she started, and it seems to pick up speed among others who need a target for their anger.

We are at a loss about what to do. These students are all over 18 now, so adults.

If anyone has any solid advice please let me know. We have spoken with lawyers but this may not do any good. The university and the campus police have been very responsive, but offer no help for prevention. Thanks for your ideas.

Edit: Thanks for all of the advice to get a lawyer and sue, get restraining orders, etc. We considered all of these things, as any angry and shaken parent would, when it first occurred two years ago. The wisdom gained over the past two years is that first, in this situation, lawyering up uses violence to counteract violence. It has no good end, just amplification of, and more public fueling of, the rage and injustice this situation strikes in the minds of young people and their parents. It also gives the students a platform where they are incentivized to continue to lie, by pitting adults against teens -- an age-old, no-win situation. There is no court of justice on the internet, there are no judicial or parental structures protecting anyone online (much as we try), and teens have an entire world in which to create their own realities. Remember that these are humans who have yet to reach some developmental milestones, like critical thinking. They are highly incentivized by each other to stick with their flock, and level-up in flock status. Even if the external structures of police and lawyers that we adults count on to protect us are put into place, the mercurial teenage internet has its own rules of guilt and innocence, victim and hero. It is virtual whack-a-mole, forever.

Many people asked why on earth the girls would call me. I am a well-known member of the community, I have six children, and am known for being someone everyone can talk to. When they reached out, the girls were terrified of the consequences of what was posted online. The rumor took off like wildfire, and they lost control, as we all did. Now, two years later, a strange social phenomenon has occurred, which is that the girls seem to be benefitting from the rumor that they denied. It's as if the internet itself gave them an identity, which they are now embodying in reality. There are many more kids unrelated to my son or this community who believe the rumor, and who find power in demonizing my son. Yes, he has deleted his social media except for instagram, where he has an alias.

When I posted this question, I was looking for creative, outside-the-box solutions. A commenter here made an excellent point about how the current platforms for victims might actually be fueling this problem, but unfortunately the trolls came after her, and she deleted her post.

Parenting,children social media,vdioeu,Social media for a 12 year old.,"So my daughter is 12 and has asked about installing Snapchat because all her friends have it. I have concerns because of the limited amount of parental controls associated with the app. I know there are adult themed snaps out there but I do not use the app.

So my questions are:

How are others handling the risks involved with an app like that? 

We do random phone checks. Is that something that is pretty normal for most parents? 

Is there a way to monitor Snapchat usage without being a helicopter parent?

I trust my daughter to make good decisions but I don't trust all the people that would have access to her profile.

Any advice is appreciated."
Parenting,children social media,vu8l5a,Is social life challenging for young children of Non-Religious Parents?,"I have seen how confrontational are some people (adults) following any religion of their land, when they hear from someone that they are non-religious.

Children of both believer and non-believer groups go to same school and share playgrounds. Please share any stories of how difficult life becomes for children of non-religious parents because of their non-believer status. 

Do you advise kids not to engage with other kids on such touchy topics (religion/politics) and be invisible? No one wants their kids harassed, attacked and outcasted from their larger groups.

Parenting,children social media,xjjepk,"Apps for tweens to chat, that don't involve social media?","My daughter has a phone, a handful of her school friends do not. Those that have phones, she can text them. The ones without phones, use their computers or tablets to chat via various apps - tiktok, snapchat, Instagram, etc. Sadly those parents think they're keeping their kids safe by not letting them have a phone, but I think the apps are the problem, not the device. Those apps seem so toxic to me. I don't want my daughter on social media at all, not yet, I think it's unsafe and unhealthy at this age (she's 11, most of her friends are 12). 

My daughter says she understands and agrees that social media is bad, she's seen it cause major problems with her peers. Also, I shared with her a recent study I read concerning false information being spread on tiktok and she found that whole idea scary. She said ""teens don't have the right brain cells to tell what's real and what's not, and anyone can say anything online and it seems believable."" (she's trying to explain brain development back to me, her words aren't quite right but I'm glad she gets it). So she understands my viewpoint. But she is upset that she is unable to chat with these friends outside of school and it's affecting her social life. She admittedly doesn't have many friends and has always struggled in socializing. 

We use Google's Family Link and an app called Bark to make sure she's staying safe. Is there an app she can use to chat with people, that plays well with Family Link and Bark? One that isn't going to open her up to the online bullying and other issues that come with social media? I think Snapchat seems the least bad, but idk. I'd love any input from more tech savvy parents, and parents who've been down this road with their kids already."
Parenting,children social media,sqxo99,I really hate social media. It broke my kid apart,"My son is an avid makeup enthusiast at age 14 and he started to do makeups from famous MUAs etc. Then he started to post them on Twitter. At first,it was very cool and random people would give him tricks and tips. Then perverts started to fill the comments,dick pics were occasionally sent him from DMs. It writes he is 14 on his account. We had to close the account. He just opened the account for sharing his work and taking tips,suggestions and tricks from other people. I suggested Twitter because he could control it much better than Instagram also I am an avid Twitter user so I thought it would be much easier.  It wasn't.

I saw what online bullying was from the first hand on a teenager. I know my son will be OK because he have grown in an open environment where he won't be judgedbut he is hurt,deeply hurt. He did not want to go out from his bed for 2 days and he is gradually getting over it,thanks to his school counselor (that guy is a gem) but he will never forget this.

Parenting,children social media,wjeicm,Socializing children,"As a kid I was a very social person. I had tons of friends and would play with them everyday. As I grew up and stuff happened, my social skills are trash now, especially with other parents since I had my oldest (9f) at a young age where other parents are a bit older than me. My daughter has friends at school and seems pretty sociable, but never wants to talk to friends or play with them when she’s home. She just wants to watch tv or play video games. I’ve limited screen time, but also I know it’s on me to coordinate with other parents to set up play dates or something. I’m more than happy to have her friends over if she’d like (I’ve even suggested it to her) but she never takes the offer.

Parenting,children social media,r43q21,Do you allow your friends/family to share pictures of your child on social media?,"Looking for different perspectives on this as I feel strongly that we shouldn’t allow friends and family to share our son’s pictures on social media but my partner disagrees and says it’s kind of mean not to let them, here’s a summary of each of our thoughts…

Me:
- I don’t know the vast majority of the people who would end up seeing his photos, so how can I teach him in future about internet safety and to not share his personal info, photos etc with strangers online if I’ve allowed it to happen his whole life.
- When he is old enough to understand, he may be unhappy with his baby and childhood photos being online, he wouldn’t have control over them and I’d have no power to enforce their removal either if he wanted them deleted.
- I don’t know, or have control over, the privacy settings of other peoples accounts and total strangers to both us and the person sharing the photos may be able to find them.
- To clarify, I have no issue with family and friends taking and sharing photos privately with specific people they’d like to show them too, it’s the posting on social media to their several hundreds of friends that I take issue with. Once our son is old enough to understand, he can of course make his own decision at that point.

Other half:
- Thinks it’s sad that the people who love and are close to us and our baby won’t be able to share photos of them with him, to their wider network.
- Believes it’s inevitable that he will have a social media presence in this day and age and that sharing photos of the kids in your family and friendship circles is the norm now.
- Believes the risk of sharing photos is minimal and very unlikely to be seen by anyone dangerous.

I do understand my partner’s points but I just know I would be mortified if I grew up to find out that not only my parents but also my aunts, uncles, grandparents and family friends had all been posting my baby/childhood photos for years, but is this just the new norm and I’m being too uptight!?

Advice and other parents’ perspectives welcomed please!!

I’ve vocalized this to my husband and told him I’d prefer that nobody posts about our daughter unless we do. I just got a notification that his grandfather tagged me in a post of our daughter on Facebook after my husband had vocalized with his entire family that I am not okay with that. As the mother of our daughter, I’d hoped they’d respect that, but all I’m being met with is backlash from his family. He’s said on numerous occasions that him and I agreed on this stance and it’s not fair that they’re giving me backlash and has addressed it with them. They’re saying I’ve “brainwashed” him and I’m being stingy with our child. Am I asking too much that they don’t post a picture of her every time they are sent one?

Parenting,children social media,wvulrb,Social media,"Hello! New mom here seeking advice about social media posts of baby. 

Since pregnancy, I knew I wanted to keep the social media posts about pregnancy and my baby once born to be as minimal as possible. This is no issue for me, however my sister-in-law posts daily about her child, and I saw the potential conflict about not posting our baby from pretty early on. So baby was born, and I ended up sharing some professional photos we had taken on my page. Some weeks go by, and she did fortunately ask permission to share photos of my baby and her child, which I told her was fine for this particular time, and thanked her for asking. Since then, SIL has watched my baby for a few hours on a couple of occasions, and each time has posted photos of him to her socials without asking. I made it clear when pregnant that I didn’t want many photos of the baby online, so this should be no surprise to my sister-in-law or my husband. Now I’m at a point where I want to tell her to not post photos of my baby online, and talked to my husband about this, hoping he could help me talk to his sister about this. He is not backing me up at all, even stating he will make me be the bad guy to deliver the message to her. As for him, he barely posts on social media at all, not sharing anything about the baby (or our wedding, ha!). 

Am I being the bad guy in this scenario? I feel like my husband is not backing me up at all, and makes me very sad and disappointed."

I assume a lot of fellow school parents will be checking up on other school parents (because I plan to) and (especially) my fb page is not exactly SFW? Plus it looks like the school itself uses FB to organize activities and spread news. I worry that any weirdness on my part might translate into awkward situations for my kiddo. 

So, I am considering starting a somewhat more conventional front account with a sort of highlight reel of my life.

Parenting,children social media,tgavyd,"Teens, depression, and social media. HELP!!!","I need help. I feel like my step daughter is depressed (which seems to be a pandemic in and of itself with teen girls these days). She's 13 years old; I have been in her life since she was 4 and was promoted to step-mom in 2019. She splits time between her mom's house and our house. Both her dad and myself have seen a huge shift in her personality over the past year or so. It seems to be coinciding with the pandemic as well as social media. We are on four different wait lists for family therapy so in the mean time....idk maybe just hearing from other people who are on the same boat might help. It's a little difficult because her mom just simply thinks she needs the phone taken away and that will solve everything. Her dad and I think limiting the phone is a step in the right direction, but at this point we think the phone coupled with the social ramifications the pandemic had has just really taken its toll on her. 

For example this morning- her mom called us to say she was refusing to go to school and about to have a panic attack because she left her eye lash curler at our house (side note I did not even know kids her age knew how to use an eye lash curler so that's news to me lol). Her mom said ""she's just super emotional right now because its her time of the month i think"" but in my mind I'm like ""that's not being emotional...that's having *serious* self image issues"" I mean I was 13 years old once too and it's when I started dabbling in make up. But I would never NOT go to school because I was out of mascara. When the thought of going to school without curled eye lashes makes you have a straight up panic attack- that's not normal behavior. 

This is just the most recent example...there's tons more. Idk maybe just some advice, book recommendations, or encouragement is all I need after this morning 😅"

Edit: My husband and I have open door conversations with our children and they are always open back with us! I’ve made her aware of potential threats of having a phone too. 

She wants to start walking halfway home alone and having a phone with her gives me a bit of peace of mind or in case of an emergency and someone else has to pick her up I can send her a quick text. 

Recently my daughter school, but in my niece (10) classroom they had a sub who started yelling and touched one of the kids (not-sexually) but in a threading matter and all the kids pull their phones out and recorded the whole situation. 

My daughter is not interested in social media and I’ve spoken to her about the threats and that once she is older we can reconsider.

Parenting,children social media,v4pdou,Social media boundaries for tweens,"My (42f) child (12f) set up her own tik tok account  unbeknownst to her father (46m) and I. At first I thought I would ban social media in it’s entirely until high school, but after thinking about it for some time I figured it would be better if she had one social media account to kind of dip her toes in the water and with our guidance, learn how to use social media responsibly. 

So my husband and I agreed she could keep her tik tok account with the understanding that she has to friend us and we get to go on her phone and look through her account and see who is interacting with her as well as her interactions with others. 

She mostly uses her account to post pictures of her drawings and art. 

However, every time I go on her account she gets quite angry and says she feels like I’m violating her privacy. I remind her that this was the agreement for her having an account but she still loses her shit and throws a tantrum every single time. 

She’s only 12 and because she has severe ADHD, she’s behind in social/emotional maturity, which is the reason I wanted to allow her to learn social media with guidance as opposed to giving her free reign when she is a teen. But I can see she feels like her privacy is being violated and it clearly upsets her when I go through her account. I gave her the choice of either deleting the account or being able to keep it knowing that I will still be going into her account and checking it. She agrees to it but it’s still very upsetting to her and I don’t want her to resent me for violating her privacy, yet I also need to make sure pervs aren’t creeping on her profile trying to talk to her. 

So I guess I would just like to know what are your rules for social media? Am I being unreasonable? I’m open to any and all suggestions as I am just venturing into the world of parenting an almost teenager and have no clue what I’m doing and clearly am doing something wrong."

Parenting,children social media,tyzkqd,Baby/child photos on social media,"Before the birth of our baby, my husband and I agreed we wouldn't allow baby photos on social media. Partially because we wanted time to announce the news ourselves but also because we want to give our children the choice of what photos are saved to the internet, as well as security issues of child abuse and identity theft. We communicated this to both our families and everyone had been obliging. 

At christmas with my husband's family, my MIL expressed that she was 'struggling' with not being able to share photos of our little one. I explained our security concerns again. Since then my SIL has posted about 3 photos of our baby to facebook. While I think the odd photo here and there is harmless, the principle annoys me especially because I feel like my family would ask first and I think my SIL is being vindictive. Its also one of my pet hates when people use baby photos for 'likes'. Neither of us actually have facebook, I only found out because someone else told me.

Parenting,children social media,10nst91,"My kind, smart, beautiful 12 year old, tried to overdose a few days ago.","Writing this to help me process. I'm raw and shaken, so please be gentle if you respond.

We've had our wonderful daughter in therapy since she was 8 after she asked to go due to bullying at school.  Things have been up and down, but in the last 13 months, my mother died, and my daughter said she was having suicidal thoughts about it. Then she started to cut herself.  She went to a behavior health hospital and started with a psychiatrist in addition to her counselor as well as started at a new private school and began medication. A few months later, my brother died. He had bipolar disorder which my daughter was diagnosed with: Bipolar II to be exact.   After that, my daughter started getting into trouble at the new private school and she started being bullied over texts from her peers there. She asked not to go back in the Fall. 

In the summer we were able to switch schools again. Then in September, my daughter asked to be hospitalized because she wasn't feeling safe. She couldn't really explain what that meant, but she was adamant about going back. Her Dad/my husband and I tried to accommodate her needs. Knives and meds locked up, lots of family time and support. She had started going to a small new middle school were the kids were kinder and the teachers are so nurturing. But it didn't matter. 

 After that second hospitalization we were over 10K in debt with her hospital bills. We stopped paying into our retirement to afford the monthly payments.  Worse yet, during the height of COVID our insurance had waved the $45 copay for counseling. That ended this month.  

Then last week out of nowhere, my daughter overdosed before going to school. She had been secretly pocketing her meds.  And probably hadn't swallowed them for 4-5 weeks. Luckily, she became afraid when the medication began to affect her, and she went to a teacher for help. 911 was called.  I watched her have a seizure in the ER.  I work in healthcare, and I stayed in ""work brain"" to cope with everything, but the image of her seizing haunts me at night.

So she is safe and back in the behavioral health hospital.  I gave up looking for a bridge program last time, but this time I spent two days calling, searching, emailing, working with social workers and I FINALLY found a bridge program to help her after the hospital.  Knowing we have a longer-term plan and that she won't just be thrown back into life immediately only to get sick again is probably the only thing keeping me afloat now. 

We are a tight, fun, loving family. There's never been an ounce of abuse or trauma other than a move from one state to another for work when our girls were 8 and 12.  It's so difficult being a parent and having so many people presume some kind of abuse occurred, because why else, right? Why would such a great kid try and kill herself at the age of 12?  It's mental illness. If I hadn't grown up watching my brother, I'd probably not believe it either.  And I thought I'd escaped my own family life, growing up with a sick and often physically and emotionally abusive brother.  I was so happy when I left all that behind, but now it's back and it's attacking my child.  I never thought my genes would carry this and torture my children. 

If you made it this far, thanks for reading. I have to return to work soon because we need the money and I'm so afraid that I'm going to lose it there. So I'm writing this as a purge and a therapy to myself. I am also seeking out therapy for myself through work.  Lots of phone tag so far. 

&#x200B;

TLDR: My 12 year old daughter is on her 3rd hospitalization after her first suicide attempt by overdose. She had a seizure in the hospital which was the scariest thing I've ever faced. I'm hanging on by a thread and needed to write it all out as a type of therapy.  I love that girl more than I can express adequately.  Please be kind if commenting."

We spend the day trying to distract her so we can get our own things done (cleaning, cooking, spending time on social media). We enjoy very little of our day with her company especially when she gets naggy, rightfully so. We are aware that she has grown older and so has more energy to spend but we don’t know how we’re supposed to help her get her energy out as we live in an apartment complex far from city center, don’t have a car and can’t afford or trust the daycares around us. So we never go out and only take her out either to the outdoors playgrounds during summer or to her grandparents house once a month.  We feel like our best days with her are being wasted as we’re mostly tired and frustrated while she’s trapped with us and the same toys forever at home.

They can have a dumb phone at the age of around 8 (situation dependant) to get in touch with us in emergencies and a smart phone at 11 when they go to secondary school so they can be part of school WhatsApp chats (or whatever the future equivalent is) but no closed social media like Snapchat and any other platform like Facebook has to be regularly monitored with us holding the passwords and limitations on screen time. We plan to bring balance through providing other compelling alternatives like sport and music etc, and that was a point of importance for us.

We decided that computer and internet access will be introduced when it becomes important for school and we will vet which TV shows are appropriate from infancy. Video games will be educational only. I see so many posts about kids, and know so many adults who have become video game addicts or spend an inappropriate amount of time playing games at the expense of other things.

Parenting,children social media,tbq4g9,Narc grandmother/social media help,"Longer post but needing some guidance as to what you’d do…

I have a narcissistic estranged grandmother. I know “narcissist” is thrown around a lot now, but this woman is the definition of it. 

My mom is a cycle breaker. She barely made it out, but she did. Toward the end, she experienced some physical violence too. Cops won’t do anything about it because of my grandmothers age and because she plays the sweet old woman, but she is still mentally there and is still really strong and is progressing with her abuse. 

I want to continue breaking the cycle, especially because I’m pregnant and I want to protect my baby from that sort of world. I was raised by someone who suffered from the abuse but isn’t a narcissist themselves. I didn’t come out unaffected by it, but it could’ve been worse. I’ve done a TON of healing from my own experience/trauma to make sure I don’t affect my baby too negatively. I’m quite stable but I have my moments. 

Here is where I need help…..

I’m excited for my baby. I cannot wait for their arrival (even though I’m only 16 weeks). I’m proud to be their momma already. And I want to celebrate this and share it on social media, especially because my fiancés family lives far away, so social media helps keep us close. I don’t have anyone who can see my posts on any social media that keep in contact with my grandmother or would for sure report back to her. I have two who MAY report but it isn’t confirmed/we aren’t certain if they would.

They are on “restricted” so they see no posts. However I do have them on my friends list, so unless I block them entirely, they will see profile and cover photo updates. My grandmother and her siblings are completely blocked. 

I feel stuck because I want to do family photos and use them as my profile pictures because I grew up with no love or family and I want my child to feel a strong sense of family. But then they will know I’m pregnant and MAY or may not report back to my grandmother. As far as I know my grandmother doesn’t know about my engagement, which I posted as a profile picture, because we haven’t received anything from her threatening it. The people who may report DID see this cover picture update. 

However I don’t want to hide my child. I don’t want them growing up thinking I can’t express my pride in our family or love like what I grew up feeling. I also don’t want them feeling like they are being hidden because of who they are instead of because I’m protecting them from my grandmother. 

So would you stuff what you want down (using them/ultrasound pictures in profile pictures) for when our family is more healed (perhaps my child will be able to feel free to make choices) and the threats are no longer there? Or would you go ahead and post them? 

I know it seems silly and probably obvious what I should do, but my anxiety is high so hard for me to think straight. 

My fiancé said that he thinks we can post what we want when we want, but IF something comes of it then we protect them. I just don’t know. 

Would you do something else? Please help this pregnant hormonal momma out lol"

He is in favour of it, excited to share her growth with more distant family and friends (ones that he wouldn't regularly message) while I am concerned about identity theft, creating a digital footprint my child didn't consent to, and the fact that we have no way to predict how privacy policies may charge in the future. Would love to hear you're you decided to either post it not post, or any safety precautions you choose to take."
Parenting,children social media,sxk1js,Why do lastborn children have more experiences with peer socialization than 1st borns do?,"I can’t help but notice that children with older siblings tend to have more experiences with peer socialization than 1st borns do. Including my youngest daughter, who’s 13 (her older sister is 16). My younger daughter is more socially advanced than my oldest was in middle school. From a young age, my 13 year old was better at: playing with large groups of children, reading facial expressions, reading body language, being considerate about how other people would feel if she did this or that, putting herself into someone else’s shoes, respecting people’s boundaries, resolving peer conflicts without my help, controlling her emotions, thinking before saying, and reducing unexpected behaviors that’d make other kids her age uncomfortable (i.e violating someone’s personal space, sneezing without covering her mouth, interrupting people). 

My 16 year old always looked like she was only beginning to learn social skills, with the help of me and her dad. She didn’t pick things up as naturally.

Based on what I’ve observed in other families, this is true for a lot of them also. For instance, my neighbor’s 3 year old with multiple pre-teen and teenage siblings is using her manners (please, thank you, sorry, welcome) at a quicker pace than I’d expect for a child her age. The kid’s parents told me that their older kids didn’t learn manners that quick."
Parenting,children social media,hahjhb,My husband and I deleted all social media apps off of our phones,"though it’s been kinda weird... I realized I’m spending more time with my kids and they’re more well-behaved. I think it’s because they got some attention from both parents. 

We’ve also been less stressed with social, media, and political news that was constantly being thrown at us. I miss the days where Facebook was just a forum and not crazy ads and now Instagram is turning into that.

Part of this post is withdrawals... I tried going on and saw no apps and well, Reddit it is! 

Anyway, looking to connect with parents who’ve done this... activity ideas are welcomed!

Edit: the well-behaved kids part only last two days. We’re back to misbehaving toddlers."
Parenting,children social media,10ma6fv,Advice,My teenage children f(15) m(17) lost their dad two years ago. Their dad and I were highschool sweethearts and right before his death separated. Long story short he cheated on me and was living with someone at the time of his death. We were still married and amicable. My children don’t like the woman. Every year during his passing anniversary or birthday she posts something on social media on HIS page. My daughter gets so upset because she feels I am his widow and she’s just a horrible woman who was with a married man. Should I say something to her? Should I tell her to stop posting? I feel as i should.
Parenting,children social media,10ki4g9,Should I let my 12 year old daughter get Instagram?,"My daughter has just started high school this year and the conversation has now turned to social media. She wanted to get TikTok, I said no. Now she has asked to get Instagram, she asked me tonight and it ended in tears with her saying “I don’t understand her and all her friends have it and she it’s going to be the weird one without”

I am a young dad and very much in the tech scene. I do full get the desire to have Insta and be in the crowd but I worry about the risks of body persecution issues, mental health and everything else that is coming to light about social media. 

I thought TikTok was too addictive. 

Am I doing the right thing here? My partner fears I am saying no to everything and my daughter will end up resenting me and doing it anyway and not talking to us anymore. 

My and my daughter get on so well but these things are super difficult."

Why does she want this platform etc. Now question is, do y'all allow y'alls tweens on social media? How many platforms have y'all allow the to have? Husband will most likely deny haha but I think it opens door for tweens to learn world, culture, languages etc. Or am I crazy?"
Parenting,children social media,108b486,"Wife is starting to check-out. She says ""I don't want to be a mom anymore.""","I(29M) and my wife (28F) have 2 beautiful daughters (3.5 and 1.5). We both work from home and the kids attend daycare. Neither one of us feels like we have the full skillset in being a parent. I do the cooking, cleaning, and spending the most time with the kids, and she does the organizing, scheduling appointments, and helps out if I need another hand with the kids. Both of us will get burnt out relatively quickly spending time with the kids.

&#x200B;

The 3yo and the 1yo don't really play well with eachother, I think it's probably just an age thing. the 1 yo can't talk yet and enjoys breaking stuff, while the 3yo is enjoying putting things together and hosting imaginary tea parties. This usually results in our 1yo being Godzilla and smashing through the tea party or castle the 3yo was making. Sometimes we will say to our 3yo that if she doesnt want 1yo to break the stuff she is trying to make, that she should go into her room and close the door until she is finished. 

&#x200B;

Our 3yo is an amazing brilliant girl that has some behavioral issues and is causing issues at the daycare. She has got some incredible sass and is very strong willed. She is making is hard at daycare with not letting anyone take a nap and being a monster in the afternoons, because she still needs her nap, but don't want to take it.

&#x200B;

We just moved to a new city to be closer to a wife's brothers family, but there's a bit of a falling out there now, and we've only seen them 5 times  in the past year despite only being 10 minutes away. Meanwhile, we both have remote jobs, and have no social life. Sometimes one of us has to travel for work and the other will need to run as single parent for 1-3 days.

&#x200B;

I try to ease my wife's burden as much as possible, I make sure that I get up at night if the girls make a fuss, I will wake up with them and make breakfast and get them ready and drive them to school. They say that in a successful relationship, both partners should be doing 70% of the work. I feel like I am doing that. 

&#x200B;

Lately though, she has been wanting to sleep more, not be around the kids as much as possible, and sometimes being grumpy but in the room with the kids, which I will tell her to take some time alone to clear her mind. Often times I will see her just browing social media on her phone while the kids are awake. I've told her how I don't like it, and that she should be present if she's around the kids and if she needs to take a break to do whatever that she can go to the bedroom.

&#x200B;

Today she's told me, "" I don't want to be a mom anymore"". Unfortunately I didn't have much to say, I told her that maybe this is some sort of late PPD. I think that she probably needs to see a therapist, because I can't be that for her. However, she has tried therapy in the past (4 sessions? some sort of art therapy) and says it's a waste of time and doesn't help her.

&#x200B;

I think what may have casued this is the prospect that I will be going on a work trip for 2 days next week that will run into a saturday, and depending on how things go I might get back home as early as saturday night or as late as sunday at noon. She can handle getting the girls ready in the morning and taking care of them after daycare until bedtime, but the weekend has long periods of unstructured time where the kids need entertainment. Luckily there's TV if we need it, we only watch during the weekends and typically only for up to 2 hours in a day (1 movie, or a couple episodes of something). My 3yo sticks like glue to a screen, but the 1 yo will watch for about 5 minutes before wandering off to do something else. 3yo will also accumulates explosive anger as she watches TV, she will become incredible irriatable if she watches too much, so we actually only really prefer up to 20 minutes at a time. 

&#x200B;

I can't do this all on my own. I'm a decent Dad, but I recognize that there is no way that I could be a full-time stay at home father, let alone a single father.  I need her to get better. We need friends, but have no time to make any. I think a therapist is probably the best thing for her, but I will need to convince her to at least give it another shot with a different therapist.


Edit: thank you for your comments. I've read all of them and dont have enough time to respond to all of them. Thank you for sharing your stories. I've since talked to my wife, she says she's on the fence about therapy (which is better than before), but will talk to her GP about antidepressants. I'm also scheduled to have therapy next week. I have a lot of baggage I've accumulated over the past 3 years, and recognize talking to a therapist in a constructive way is the best way forward. I still disagree about the phone use as she puts in a lot of hours everyday, but I will back off(not that I've said anything except for one time) until after a few months of therapy and medication, maybe it will solve itself. We will be looking into a new babysitter for days that  I'm away for work and even just for a date night once we find one we are comfortable with. I am also planning an inhouse special surprise date night for after the kids are asleep. Thanks for the feedback :)"
Parenting,children social media,10lg5ry,Parental alienation,"I won’t go into detail on this matter because it’s not my situation but I’d like to help a friend with advice. 

For context: My friend has been going through a custody battle with his ex wife. As soon as he got remarried, suddenly he became a danger to his children and was completely segregated from his children. Courts got involved and now they have an order in place. Mom was never held accountable for all the attempts made to contact and visit, but has consistently kept pushing for visits despite her discouragement. 

Recently he was able to have a visit. The first visit since being segregated. Kids had an awesome time and it was like old times. Now he can not get mom to answer the phone, text messages, social media messages and is now considering calling a welfare check since no one has responded. It’s been a week today. 

Anyone have any advice?"

Parenting,children social media,o49qb9,How do you not lose your mind with your girls dancing provocatively on social media?,"I've got a teenage boy so it hasn't been an issue for me.  But my buddy has three girls and he's really struggling with it. He's tried confiscating their phones, grounding and other forms of punishment.  He's also tried his best to be understanding and allow for some freedom. It was actually his wife who found videos of their twelve year old daughter and freaked out.

Another friend has a 16 year old who's very active on TikTok.  He's at the point where he doesn't even want to know anymore. He simply said whatever he says isn't going to make her stop craving the attention.  He suspects there is nudity but doesn't want to know for sure. He doesn't want to fight about it every few days.  I've known this dude for 30 years.  Tough as nails catcher in highschool and varsity ball.  Straight up dude-bro and stoic.

Parenting,children social media,102abr4,Food portions - ex and I disagree,"My 9 year old son has started to ask for adult meals when taken out for food - for example, he asked for a Big Mac meal when he was last bought a McDonald's.

I have been buying him whatever he asks for food wise, as I simply do not want to have to deal with him being upset - and at any rate, I was eating adult meals at his age. He was also bought an adult meal by his stepfather before I'd even thought of allowing him to have one.

The trouble is that my ex, when finding out what I was ordering for our son, criticised me at length on Whatsapp for it. When I pointed out that she, or rather her husband, had also bought him an adult meal, she said 'that was a one-off' and resumed criticising me.

This died down a little. However, I had both boys (we also have a 5 year old, who happily still eats kids' meals) for Christmas. I chose to take them to spend it with my family. During this time we were bought a couple of takeaways as a treat, among other things. The 9 year old didn't leave a scrap of food at any point, other than some pizza crusts.

My ex demanded I return the boys on Boxing Day, so I agreed to this. I returned the boys on Boxing Day early on in the evening. I hadn't even got back to my home when I got a ping on Whatsapp. It was my ex, complaining that she'd weighed both boys and they had 'put on a substantial amount of weight'. I have pretty much ignored this. Neither boy is even close to an unhealthy weight.

Even before we split up, my ex and I used to clash over portion sizes. I felt she never gave the boys quite enough food, and indeed they used to often complain about being hungry - the older boy even resorted to smuggling bags of crisps. At the time I didn't feel able to openly go against my ex as she was known for criticising me loudly to her friends, and even over social media, if I went against her.

There was even one time that, when our elder son was a year old, he was taken into town by my sister and her boyfriend. When it turned out they'd bought him a Greggs sausage roll and allowed him to eat the whole thing, she spent an entire evening telling me what a horrible person my sister was for 'overfeeding' her nephew.

My family and I don't think I have done anything wrong, but given how seriously my ex seems to be taking it, I'm wondering if I should be more assertive and insist the 9 year old has a child's portion.

EDIT: During the video call with the boys today, my ex made a comment about feeding the boys. Pretty sure she's reading this. Hi Amy!"
Parenting,children social media,10i9uaj,15 year old daughter keeps running away,"My 15 year old seems to think that when things don’t go her way, or she doesn’t get what she wants she can run away for a few days and not contact me or her father. We see her active on social media and she’s in contact with friends but she won’t answer texts or calls from us. The first time (which was about 2 weeks ago) she ran away because I took her cell phone from her and grounded her. This time I’m guessing it’s because I got on her about her grades and making sure she prioritizes school first then extracurricular activities and her job after. Both times I reported her to the police as a run away. Last time after being gone for two days one of her friends gave me an address for where she was and I went there and knocked on the door and told them to send her out or I was sending the police. This time I’m not doing it. I read an article that said that we shouldn’t give her the power. I don’t know how I feel about that. It’s hard. As much as I want to find my daughter and bring her home, me getting her home doesn’t guarantee she won’t just do the same thing again next weekend.  I can’t keep doing this. The police will contact me if they run into her… but I’m not running around like a headless chicken looking for her while she hangs out and ignores us and doesn’t consider our feelings. She has to follow the rules. She can’t just keep running away every time something doesn’t go her way. What can I do?????


UPDATE!!!!! 1/22 12:10 

SHE IS HOME!!!!

Thank you so much for all of your feedback! Even though some of your comments were unkind, most of your advice was extremely helpful. Thank you for helping me see things from a different point of view!!! You all were right in saying I need to try a different approach! And I am going to!!! I think I was being way too hard on her. I just didn’t want her to make any mistakes that she couldn’t come back from so I was being way to overprotective. I just want her to have a better life than I had. My way was clearly not working though and I’m not too prideful to admit it or change my ways. I messaged her this morning telling her exactly that, and that we need to sit down and talk and work together and not against each other!! I told her I loves her and I missed her and I wanted her home. She left me on “read” for a few hours… lol but she walked in and we had the best hug I think we’ve ever had. Thank y’all so much for your open and honest opinions! I really needed that eye opener as a parent!!!!"

I have been asked a few times by extended family and I feel really guilty and awkward but I tell them no, please don’t. I just don’t like the idea that I don’t know everyone who can see it and share it via their page. 

I do post my daughter on my own page because I have a very private friends list and really strict privacy settings. I don’t even have her in my profile photo because that can be seen by public.

Is this an unpopular opinion/am I weird for this? I know they want to share photos of their niece/great granddaughter etc so I do feel really bad saying no, but it just makes me uncomfortable."
Parenting,children social media,zj95qi,What are the most ridiculous “my child was doing xxx by xxx age” type claims you’ve heard?,"We all have at least one parent in our family/social circle that makes simply ridiculous claims about their child/children. Their kids slept through the night from the day they were born; all four of their children could read before kindergarten; their child never go sick not even once; their teenagers never talked back like ever. You know the type 😂 Today someone claimed to me that all 3 of their children were toilet trained by 11 months old. A bold claim on its own seeing as the average 11 month old can just about walk but considering this person’s (now adult) are 11 and 10 months apart respectively their claim borders on nonsensical. Maybe I’m failing as a parent but I simply can’t comprehend managing that at all let alone with those age gaps. Normally my tactic is to simply do a massive internal eye roll and then just not engage in a way that’ll result in any sort of back and forth. Something like “I’m so excited for mine to start reading” or “some babies really love long naps right?” or simply ignoring the comment and gently steering the conversation in another direction but today’s encounter had me fighting back a snort. What are some ridiculous things you’ve heard people claim about their kids? How do you respond when these type of comments are made?

EDIT: Wow I did not expect so many people to respond but it’s nice to know I’m not the only one wondering if these conversations/comments will cause me to roll my eyes so hard one day that they’ll simply get stuck lol. Also isn’t it interesting that so many of these “brags” or whatever you wanna call them centre around basic human functions- sleep and sh*t 😂 There’s definitely a lot of selective memory happening and I also think they’re both just such basic skills that we forget that there was a point our children weren’t able to do them independently. Hope everyone’s having a nice December and can’t wait to read more ridiculous parent posts in the future haha. 

P.S. I am very aware of what EC is and it’s role in leading to fully independent toilet use. BUT those who’ve used this technique aren’t the folks I’m referencing here haha. I mean the people who insist their child was able to use the toilet without assistance at all at an absolutely ridiculous age."
Parenting,children social media,106t72w,Am I a crap mom for wanting to work instead of being a SAHM even if we can afford it?,"I (30 F) just had an uncomfortable heated discussion with my in-law side of the family and husband and I’m starting to doubt if I maybe am being unreasonable. 

Quick background: I am a qualified architect and started my own design company last year. It has been going well and work has really started to pick up and I am extremely grateful and excited for both my existing and future projects. My husband is also a qualified contractor.

So My husband’s father passed away suddenly about a year ago and my husband (30) received a quite a substantial inheritance that will allow for a comfortable life for us as a family. We are extremely grateful, but we miss him terribly and wish he’d still be here.

We have 2 children of which one is three and the other four months. I have been working from home and our eldest has been going to daycare. Since having our youngest, I haven’t been working and I am due to start working again next week. We have a wonderful and caring nanny that will help with our youngest. This setup has upset my MIL and her family (none of the women had a career and were all SAHM) who feel that I do not need to work and we can afford for me to stay home with the kids. I tried to explain that I love what I do and I want to work. I have always wanted to work for myself and it is finally starting to go well. I am not cut out to be a SAHM although I have huge respect for those mommies that are.

My MIL and husband constantly dismisses me when we are in conversation with someone  where I am discussing my career and says something along the lines of ‘Yeah, but you don’t HAVE to work and should be at home with your babies.’ They make me feel guilty for wanting to work. I only work in the mornings and late evenings when they are in bed - the rest of the time I spend with them so I am not neglecting them. 

Am I being a shitty mom for wanting to work even if I ‘don’t have to’ financially? Is it ‘selfish’ as my MIL is making it seem?

Edit 1: Wow! Thank you all for your responses! I really appreciate it. I feel that I need to clarify something. So my husband is very supportive, always has been and he has seen the worst of me (especially through university during all-nighters), so he does not ‘force’ me to stay at home and not work. But he does agree with his mother whenever the topic arises where my career is being discussed.

He is happy with me working, but he was raised by a SAHM and loved it, so he has this same vision he would have liked to give to our kids. I think it is time though that we should sit down and I should just be straight and say I am not giving up my career and that it’s not up for discussion. 

He knows how hard I worked to get where I am so he should respect that.

He inherited the family business as well so he works full-time and he can’t stay home either.

Edit 2: My career is my passion and my hobby and I will make a point of telling people who comment on it that it is important to me. It allows me to be flexible and with having a home office, I’m always there. Obviously my kids will always be my priority, but our 3 year old thrives in daycare and is a social butterfly. I was lucky to be home with her until she turned 1 and I am lucky now to have been staying home with our youngest and I will continue to be close to her, just in the office during mornings and maybe some afternoons.

Edit 3: Sometimes the amount of pressure placed on women is insane. We can’t have a career and be a mom or be a mom and not help financially. Damned if we do and damned if we don’t"
Parenting,children social media,z20t5s,Life without mom (update from a 2020 post),"I've got 5 kiddos, 12 and under. Their mom and I went through divorce in the height of Covid in early 2020 which was a nightmare but such a blessing too.  We were together 15 years but divorce truly was for the best and I felt so relieved, she made everyone's life hell.  At the time of separation (in early 2020), CPS got involved and deemed her unfit to parent due to proven abuse and neglect of our kids (during our separation) and her severe mental illnesses (spanned for years) that she wouldn't care for, not to mention her very long history of suicide attempts as well.  I was given full custody of our kids and our marital home in may 2020.  She immediately fled (in may 2020) and moved in with a new boyfriend, which has since become her husband.  

She called our children off and on from random phones from july 2020 till october 2020.  Every phone call the kids would plead and beg of her to come back around and visit them.  She's such a heartless narcissist though that she only cared about boasting about her new life and how great it was.  We broke off contact when she would call boasting happily about how she was expecting a ""new brother or sister"" and how she ""was moving to Florida"" (we live in Michigan).  They've since moved to Florida, she's been replacing our children's memory because they're currently on baby #3.  I only know any of this becasue of facebook info...  There's been no contact between us, she won't respond to any emails and has blocked my main social media accounts.   She abandoned our five children, fled to florida and started an entirely new family.
Myself and my children have all been in family and individual therapy since this all started and will continue to do so for quite some time.

In early 2021 my oldest child verbally told his therapist in detail about the physical abuse his mother imposed on him and his siblings in the 2 months that the lived with her during our separation period while divorce started in early 2020.  This was news to me and my children decided to harbor those details for some reason until then. It made me feel happy knowing they felt safe enough to open up though.  Even know the therapist knew their mother was out of the picture, they still had to call CPS they claimed.  CPS came out and told me the physical abuse allegations against my ex wife.  They even took a statement from my oldest child which broke my heart more to put him through talking about that again.  The CPS worker told me that they fully intended to prosecute my ex which I agreed with and that they'd be in touch with Police in the city she was believed to be living in.  They couldn't find her though and CPS had to drop the case.

Then in Mid 2021 the state scheduled a court hearing and ordered her to appear to explain why she hadn't paid a dime of child support.  She didn't show and they issued a bench warrant.  Fast forward a year till last month (in 2022), the court has now issued a felony warrant for her for not paying a dime of child support for over 2 years now.  It's very strange to think that she's building a life with a brand new family, and that she's eventually going to be arrested and charged with a felony, and the fact that those new kids will have to grow up for a while without a mother too.  

Regardless of all the drama, my kids are healthy and happy most of the time.  They're safe and loved and that's all that matters to me.  I admit, I sometimes blame myself for making a family with such a monster at all.  I know I could have never known how the future would play out all those years ago when I met her in 2005.  I just wish she would have been an honorable woman after divorce and still wanted to be in our children's lives.  Although EVERY single last person that knew her all unanimously have said that it's for the best that she's gone out of their lives...    I try to take peace in that...  Rant over I suppose...."

My husband and I already agreed that we will post a picture (not even of the kid, maybe just a onesie or something) to let people know that he or she is healthy and whatever but after that, nothing.

I shook my head at it all and was saying ""I'm glad we still have a while before my kids begin middle school"", then it suddenly hit me they my oldest is in 5th grade, which means he begins middle school next year!!! Now I'm terrified for him.

So far, he's not interested in social media. We banned YouTube a few years ago because the kids kept finding inappropriate things to watching (despite monitoring) and their attention spans were shot. Banning youtube has been the best decision we've ever made, and I tell myself ""we'll just continue to ban social media like youtube and tiktok""... But how long can we really put this off before classmates and friends begin to call them out on their lack of...connection?
...Trendiness?

We have one extra cell phone they behind to me and Dad. It does not belong to any of the kids and they cannot play on it.

This got me thinking to how I can use this time more effectively. **Are there any real solid social media accounts you would recommend?** By solid I mean non-biased, science based, education based, etc. 

For example hoping to get some ideas for fun and educational things to do with my kid/healthy food recommendations... rather than what the newest haircut trend is for kids.

Thank you.

Sorry to add, I am not too social media savvy, I don't have twitter, ticktok or other new ones, just Instagram and FB which I rarely use anymore"
Parenting,children social media,qffat2,How to deal with social media negatives,"Hello fellow parents. 

Although my daughter is only 14 weeks old I constantly find myself at a loss for what do about social media and the dangers around them. I know by the time she's old enough to have a phone we might be dealing with a whole new level of social media problems but for now I'm really dreading it. 

What age is it even appropriate to have a phone? Or even a tablet. So many scary warning videos out there about how quickly kids can get to inappropriate content for example when left to watch youtube, even Kids youtube. I'm a teacher so I see first hand some of the horrible stuff kids can do to each other. Sadly schools are ill-equipped to deal with the root of the problem. The school I work at is trying a total phone ban but you know these kids bring their phones to school anyway. Short of searches at the door which is a whole new level of problems it's happening. 

I've also been taking note of nephews and younger cousins and I just don't know what to do. My aunt was in tears earlier this year because my 13 year old cousin was being groomed by a pedophile. She said she didn't even know what half the social media platforms were, had hardly any idea what to be weary of. Things she knew about for her 17 year old weren't relevant anymore for her 13 year old and was having trouble keeping up. Honestly I get that. I can hardly keep up with what my younger sister is into never mind the kids. 

My nephew was being bullied because he was able to buy fornite skins. Bullied if he didn't have them, bullied if he did. His desperation to please was insane. He would try to shower while playing fortnite. He would play so much he'd forget to go to the toilet and wet himself. Just to please his bullies. How does a mother handle that? Let him play because it's what the kids are doing, it's what he desperately wants, or don't let him play. 

Don't even get me started on these tiktok trends. I know I probably would have avoided these things because my fear of my parents was way higher than any glory I would have gotten from these challenges and such. Which is not what I want for my daughter. Growing up scared is not it. 

Am I too paranoid? How do you handle these things?"
Parenting,children social media,ojtsxx,"Phones, devices, social media… Qs from a FTM","My son is only a toddler, so it’s a bit early, but I’d like to set him up for “success” as much as possible 

Maybe bc my husband and I both work in tech, we’re sensitive to these things. We don’t let him play with our phones or watch YouTube, he gets a little tv time on the weekends and that’s it. 

What is the right process for introducing devices and social media to kids these days? 

If I restrict it until he’s 16 or 18 am I being withholding or controlling? 

But at the same time, my friend’s nephew committed suicide at 18 due to cyber bullying. 

And alternatively my former manager’s daughter resented him a lot for having tracking apps on her phone. 

I don’t know what the right path is. 

It seems like a lot of young kids are learning a lot from tablets and educational games, so I wouldn’t want my son to miss out on that. But being a UX Designer myself, I know firsthand the strategies companies try to employ to fuel addiction, it’s hard for me to erase that from my mind. 

What are you guys doing? Has there been any new information on the subject? Any advice? 

I’d love to hear from parents of older kids and find out what worked."

I have no issue with having my babies pictures on social media. My issue however is with family maybe posting pictures of our newborn girls before my husband and I have even had the opportunity to post any pictures first. 

Any of you had to deal with addressing this before your baby/babies birth and how do I go about it without sounding rude or disrespectful? I know people always get excited about new family members and I love the sentiment, but surely they should understand it’s our privilege as parents to do that first. For the most part I don’t think I’d even have to worry about most of the family members, but there are always those one or two… IYKYK lol

Parenting,children social media,zmqjil,My wife and I cannot agree with level of freedom,"Quick background:  
Live in safe suburb on Long Island  
Our house is NOT on a busy road  
We have 2 boys (6 and 10)  


My wife (F43) is a VERY loving mother.  She loves our boys and she will do anything for them.  I (45M) am a very loving father and will do anything for them.  We both try to validate our points with articles from those who are ""in the know.""  We both accept the world is different than it was 30 years ago  


Today, like many times before, we discussed what is acceptable freedom.  My wife is a helicopter mom.    She watches from the door if my 10 year old brings garbage to the curb (I tell him to bring the garbage to the curb - she would not give such a chore because in her eyes, its dangerous).  During a text discussion, I said our son (10) could not walk home from school because he does not possess the life skills or situational awareness.  We live .4 miles from the school with only 4 way crossing and no major or even fast roads.  This fact pains me as my children are not ""survivors.""  They are not allowed to be.  


I was informed about the fedex driver and other things found on scare media.  


What do I do?  Advice?  I feel my kids had their wings clipped!   They need an acceptable amount of freedom (although I don't know what that is nowadays)"

Parenting,children social media,nq2shy,Grandma over sharing on Social Media,"So I just told my Mom that I didn't want her to post anymore pictures of me or my family on Social Media anymore. I feel bad, but it had to be done. Worse than ripping a band-aid off. She loves her my family, especially her grandchildren beyond measure. Truth is, she posts way too much. Not just my family, but of herself, my siblings, their family, her friends, what she's eating, what they're eating and on and on. She lives on Social Media. I quit every MyFace tweetgram out there (Heck, I barely post anything on Reddit. I just like, dislike and post dank comments here and there).

I know she means well and she's proud of her grandchildren, but I don't want my children's online footprint to be out there before they even have a chance to say in the matter. I also do it for security reasons (fill in your worst nightmare happening because someone sees your kid on insta). 

I know they'll prolly be on tiktok and whatever, I'm not naive, maybe they won't and they'll be a hermit like their pops. It's not up to me or my Mom who gets to see their baby pictures, it should be up to them."

Parenting,children social media,ze62dd,Age appropriate consequences,"For context I am the mother of 2 children 3 and 5.  My 5 year old son started kindergarten and has been recently diagnosed with autism.  The diagnosis was somewhat of a shock to me as I am struggling with self doubt and because his autism is less obvious than in others.

Last week I discovered that two of his presumably neurotypical peers got “grounded” for longer than a week for what appeared to me to be typical issues in their age group.  (Constant back talk and repeated disobedience in one and an experiment that resulted in property destruction in the other.). I’m not disagreeing that these issues require consequence.  Obviously kids need to learn to be respectful of others and that experiments with sandpaper are only appropriate in certain places, but do long term consequences actually prove effective in this age group?  Are there effective consequences for this age group that are more severe than time out or losing a toy but don’t require what they did a week and a half ago?

For further context I’ve never been “grounded”. As a teen I lost privileges akin  to grounding such as access to social media or the ability to go to a school dance.  As a child I was spanked and lectured."
Parenting,children social media,8s9p4u,Posting Baby Pictures on Social Media,"Does anyone else **not** post pictures of their kids on social media? 

I posted a birth announcement on Facebook with a picture or two, and that's it. We have also told family to please ask permission before posting. Our family, while mostly respecting our wishes to keep our baby off social media, thinks we're being overprotective and crazy.  My MIL posted a picture of our daughter recently, and we asked her to take it down.  My mom has even gone so far as to say that my daughter will think we don't love her because we didn't post about her on social media when she was younger \[insert dramatic eye roll here\]. 

We've explained the multiple reasons why we have made this choice, but they are still having a hard time with it. 

Here are our reasons: 

\-Her privacy and safety are of the utmost importance. I don't know what my family members' privacy settings are or who they are friends with on social media. There's a lot of creeps out there, and the internet makes it easier for them to be creepy. 

\-She should have the right to choose what is posted about her when she is old enough to decide whether she wants to have an online presence or not. This is the first generation that has no say in their online presence, and we want to respect her future choice to be online or not. 

\-We don't want her to feel embarrassed or be ridiculed for something that was posted about her online, as what is posted on the internet is there forever. 

\-We don't want her to be subjected to judgment from our followers or whomever else can view her pictures. We also don't want her to grow up feeling that she is only as valuable as the number of ""likes"" she gets on a picture or post. 

Besides, who benefits from posting these pictures online? Does it actually benefit the child? In most cases, I feel like it doesn't. 

**So... are you keeping your babies off social media? Or are we totally alone in this endeavor?** 

(I'd like to add that I am not judging those who do decide to post pictures of their children. I guess I'm just looking for a little reassurance here. I think that as parents, we all try our best to do what we think is right for our children. )"
Parenting,children social media,lm6e8a,Is it uncool to have your parent comment on your social media?,"My sons are 11, 14 and 16. The 11yo has no interest in social media but my 14 and 16yo do. I view it as a peephole into their social lives. Mainly it's them doing stupid stuff or posting feats or accomplishments. It's like their little own digital trophy shelf. They've been using it more and more. I have FB and IG mainly as the ""family"" account.

Recently, I started commenting on their posts including pictures they asked me to take of them. For example, my 14yo asked me to take a video of him jumping backwards in the pool. He uploaded it and I left a comment about how all those swimming lessons paid off. My 16yo asked me to take pictures of him prepping for his soccer game and left a comment about how he slaughter the competition with a meme. Both kids had a fit over my leaving comments. I asked them what was so bad about my comments and they said ""you."" I was baffled and they explained that kids their age do not want their dads ""trolling"" them or trying to be ""funny"" on their social media.

Parenting,children social media,zhwf5u,thoughts on weaponized incompetence?,"I've been seeing on social media in the mom influencer world a bit about weaponized incompetence which seems to be when a spouse/partner does things poorly or says they can't do things because they either don't know how, it's too stressful for them or because the other person does it better, for example. I think there are more examples but this is my basic understanding.

I feel like my spouse does this with parenting. He frequently asks for help or doesn't want to do things because he says I'm better at it. I am trying to set boundaries around this and not be taken advantage of. For example, this morning was his day to sleep in. We have an agreement that when the person sleeping in wakes up, the other parent gets to go take a nap or have personal time for at least 2 hours. 

When my spouse got up this morning (930am) he wanted to run an errand with the kids and asked for 10 minutes of my help to get everyone ready (a toddler and a 10mo). I asked ""what do you want me to do?"". He seemed annoyed that I was trying to get specific guidance on how he wanted me to help him instead of just continuing to be primary parent and doing everything.

He said ""watch the kids while I get ready"". So I said okay, I'll set a 10 minute timer. Then about part way through, he asked if I could get the baby ready. I said sure, I'll help until the 10 minutes are up.

I feel like an asshole for setting a timer for an adult but I also believe he is perfectly capable of getting himself and the kids ready on his own. I have been awake since 530am and was looking forward to taking a nap. 

AITA? Is there a more tactful and respectful way to handle these situations?"
Parenting,children social media,ysx6gt,When is it ok to snap back at my teen?,"I(m) have a 13 year old boy. We're often quite calm with him. We like to try and be civil with him as much as possible.  He gets quite cranky and angry at us at time. Honestly, it usually revolves around taking his digital media or phone away. But also I know it comes from being tired.
 
That said, he has a tendency to get snippy with us/me.  I've learned in the past, with friends, that it can be a good tactic to snap back. Sort of fight fire with fire. When getting upset and sending the same energy back, it sort of shows what they're doing and they don't like it. A bit of a reality check.

Is this an ok tactic to use sometimes?  If so, when do you decide to use it? When's it effective, and when's it more damaging?

Thanks.

Edit:. This has been an interesting ride. Thank you all for your input!  

It seems to be a bit divided.  Maybe 65/35.. 

A lot of the people who have commented have said to stay calm and not raise your voice.  The reasons seem to be; Because it will show that this sort of action is acceptable and will continue to use it.  I've heard, don't stoop to thier level, an adult would not get angry, and should be firm and calm. Mayne talk about it later with them when everything is calmed down and try to get to the root of the problem and address that.  

Then there's the other side of the topic.  Some are saying that a parent needs to be firm and ""lay down the law"". There are different tactics to this, yelling back, discipline, like taking away things until they adjust, or fighting fire with fire, a surprising amount of sarcasm talk here.  There's also people who snap back and yell because of their own frustration and then apologize later and talk about the situation. 

And there's some middle ground comments as well.  Maybe snapping back at certain points, only when the child or situation calls for it, such as they are going overboard. Or if you calmly try talking to them and they escalate.

There's been some talk about how the real world will not often match anger with calm resolve, and so it's good to give them a taste of that, in a loving manner.  There's the idea that kids need a heavy hand sometimes and someone, somehow has to be the boss and be stern.

This has been a very good, interesting conversation, and I thank you all for it!  The one thing that is constant is that all you parents care for your children and want to do what's right to make them grow up to be good adults.  I like this very much and am inspired to keep trying my best to do what's right for us.  I mean there's no manual for this stuff, right? Well... There's millions of them, but still we're all figuring this out together.  And I like that we can. We're all helping eachother to be better at this.

Keep up the good fight.. or conversation.. parents!  And... ""Try again."""
Parenting,children social media,zvov7m,At what point should suspected neglect be reported?,"I’m sorry, I’m not sure where else to post this question. I follow an old high school friend on social media and I am disturbed by the state of her 5 year old. He is very pale and frail looking and is always dressed in only a diaper. I’ve ignored this for a while because he also doesn’t speak much so I figured he has delays and maybe refuses to wear clothes and cannot potty train yet. But lately I’ve noticed his teeth are completely rotten as well. She has mentioned taking him to the doctor once and said something along the lines of “they’re wrong, he just does things on his own timeline”. So I suspect he’s not getting any kind of therapies for his obvious delays. I don’t think he attends any school or programs. He seems to just sit in their filthy house watching tv all day. He seems to have tons of toys and his own bedroom though.  Anyway, everyday that passes I feel more strongly about reported all of this to child services. But I don’t want to ruin a family’s life for nothing if it ends up not deemed neglect. This isn’t something I take lightly at all. Wondering if anyone has any advice or insight? Thank you."
Parenting,children social media,yhd6uq,Friends no longer inviting you out?,"Need some perspective here. Myself (23F) and my boyfriend (23M) have a couple we are friends with (Lily 23F/ Joe 23M) and have known and been individually been close with them since school. They have been together 5 years, we have been together for 2. We had our first child 7 months ago (unplanned but the best thing that ever happened to us). 

So, we all live about 100 miles away from our home town, coincidentally just 1 mile down the road from each other. As we all got jobs/attended university in the same city. 

So, we have a friend group of about 8 people. My boyfriend was part of it for a few years longer than me, I had separate friends before we got together, although I was still close with Lily separately. Once me and my boyfriend got together I made friends properly with the group, we have been on weekends away together, I have known most of them from school anyway so already had a familiarity. 

Since we had our baby 7 months ago, we’ve obviously been seeing them less. They are still in university and living a different life to us. My boyfriend works full time & I am on maternity leave still. We have said no to certain plans such as nights out, weekend away, basically anything revolving around alcohol as we live 100 miles away from our family, therefore no babysitters. And we’re also not big drinkers anyway. 

But then, when they do things such as lunches, walks, casual dinners, we are no longer invited anymore. For example our whole friend group drove from our home town up to Lily & Joe’s (1 mile from us) lastnight to go for a Halloween night out, and they also did this last month. Yet, the next day when they go for brunch/shopping/walks, they don’t bother to ask us. We just see it on social media. 

Our other friends also most of the time don’t bother to even tell us they’re in the area, we have seen they are via social media and invited them over to just pop in before they leave, or to pop in to my boyfriends work, and it’s always an excuse why they can’t, even when they’ve spent the whole day with Lily and Joe.

I feel like parents get a lot of the blame when friendships fall apart after having kids, but is it just me who thinks that a lot of the time non parents get offended when we can’t do the things we used to so then just stop bothering all together? 

I can’t tell if I’m being the issue here. As I’ve said we have definitely said no to multiple plans, but they have 90% all been evening/night plans revolved around drinking. Most of them also were in the first 3 months of our sons life, and it was inviting one of us out and expecting the other to stay home with the baby. Which we just didn’t want to do with such a young baby. And other times they’ve been plans such as them wanting to pop over for an hour after my boyfriend finishes work, but it’s right when I’m making dinner/bathing/putting our baby to bed. So we have said no to a few of those too, but we always explain why. We have never cancelled last minute or said no to daytime plans. We also always make sure we attend things like birthday plans.

So are we the issue here, or is this just what happens when you have children young?

Edit: should probably mention Lily is my best friend, well was before I had my baby. So I feel like maybe I expect more from her because of how close we are/were.

Update: I have spoke to Lily, and I have said I understand that me saying no several times may of made her reluctant to invite me anymore. We have both said we will make more of an effort. And she said she will tell me when group plans are made that are more baby friendly."
Parenting,children social media,nbq2tp,I (31f) Found Kids(13nb) Secret Social Medias and Inappropriate conversations,"Hi all! Please help :) I don't have anyone to go for for advice. Also, my child is non-binary, and goes by they/them, just fyi. 

Let me preface this by saying I am a 31 year old, single mom to a 13 year old kid. I grew up with in a strict household with no boundaries (no privacy, very little leniency, etc), which lead to a poor relationship with my mother as an adult. I am trying to parent my child differently so I may break that cycle. I am more lenient and open minded and have very open communication.  My rules for my child are: they can have a tiktok, instagram, and youtube account, but are not allowed to post and have to keep age appropriate settings for what they view. They can use discord, and other communication apps like that. They are allowed to play appropriate video games with their friends (minecraft, fortnite, among us, etc) after they have finished school work. I am technologically adept (Im a PC gamer, I use discord/tiktok/insta/etc) so I understand how they all work. We have boundaries, as in I do not snoop through their stuff and trust that they will behave appropriately, but I have had many talks with them about online safety and all that. 

SO NOW TO THE POINT

Today I asked to see what my childs tiktok name was so I could send them a cute video. They panicked and started acting very suspicious. They wouldn't give me the phone, admitting to having a secret second account. This lead to a tumble down the rabbit hole. After trust had been broken, I took their phone and then started looking through other apps. They have a secret tiktok, insta, snapchat, and discord. They tried to secretly log out of all of these from their laptop, thinking I wouldn't figure that out. They had been posting to their insta/tiktok/snap accounts, nothing bad, but thats besides the point. Their usernames on all the secret accounts are very inappropriate, using the words whore and slut. I didn't read too many of the discord messages, I don't want to break every boundary, but from what I did see, it includes very inappropriate, MATURE conversations and words. Now understand, I am not naive. I know kids are curious and want to act ""cool"", so I am not 100% surprised by this, but I am upset about the secrecy and lying. 

What I need advice on:

\- What do you guys think would be an appropriate way to approach this and what consequences would suffice, with out ruining the relationship we have built? I am leaning towards taking away their technology for a bit, and then after that set new rules for their social medias, but what those rules would be, idk. I am not trying to be the ""cool"" mom, but I know my options are to either cut them off from all of it somehow, break boundaries and monitor everything they do (which may make things worse), or allow them to post and what not, but I have to ok it before they post it. My main reasoning for not allowing posting is to avoid predators, but if I can ok what they post first, then I would be open to it. Ah idk. Like I said, Im not naive. They are going to do things I don't want them to do, but I want them to be safe about it!!!

\- What do I do about the inappropriate conversations they have with their friends? Im not sure there IS anything I can do other than going full crazy mode and ban them from everything, but that will hurt more than help, I feel. Kids are kids. They need to experiment and such, and I get that. But idk, it's just so inappropriate for a 13 year old. 

I just need some help, man. How do you raise a teenager, especially in a time of endless technology and social medias, to be safe and honest and aware?! Sorry for the rant. It all just happened and I am trying to figure it out and process it all before blowing up on them. THANK YOU!

**TL;DR** Child is not allowed to post on social media but I found out about secret social media accounts across all platforms, where they post regularly. Also saw very inappropriate convos with their friends. How do I handle this without breaking boundaries?"

Parenting,children social media,xd5zfl,Losing my mind over buying my boy a smartphone,"My 9-year-old son asked me today to buy him his first smartphone, because he feels left out at school.  As many of you(hopefully), I believe that the later you buy your kid a smartphone, the better. I honestly find it kind of depressing that most of my son's classmates already have one. 

He currently has an old Nokia just so we can contact each other when he's not at home or in case something happens. Occasionally we let him play some videogames on our PC, but that's about it. He has no access to the internet and it hasn't really bothered him until recently. 

When we asked him why he thinks he needs a smartphone, he told us that he'd like to connect with his friends through social media. I made sure to do some thorough research on what the average kid or even teenager does on the internet nowadays and trust me when I say that I am absolutely horrified of the thought that my kid is using TikTok, Instagram or really any other app, and slowly getting addicted to it(which is what they're actually made for in order to make money) since numerous studies have shown that frequent usage greatly reduces children's attention span over time. Not to mention porn sites where one click is enough to 'verify' that you're over 18, online predators and the amount of time that could be spent by doing something more meaningful. Our neighbors' kids(9, 11) both use a smartphone, and their parents told us several times how much they regret being pressured into buying them one.

This one is at Chuck E Cheese. It’s loud and it’s boring, but my kid is having fun. At least I can scroll through Reddit/Facebook while I’m here.

Parenting,children social media,10kk84c,Child refusing medical treatments,"My daughter will be 7 on Sat. She is generally easygoing, good listener, and social kid. When she was a toddler she had issues with anxiety when trying something new, but would always work it out by herself with support. She’s never loved shots, but got through them. She’s been great with dental cleanings and had 2 cavities taken care of w/ o any tears. She even recently had a tonsil and adenoids reduction (surgery) w/o one tear going back to the OR. Back in the fall though we went to get flu shots and there was this kid who was breaking down before his shot. Since then she’s refused to get her COVID booster and she got the flu vaccine w/ the flu must instead of needle. Now yesterday she’s at the orthodontist and refused to get spacers put in in preparation for an upper pallet expander. She’s had a lot of nasal issues and breathing at night plus a small upper pallet with adult teeth that won’t come down. The staff told her it might hurt a little and that sent her spiraling. The thing is she wouldn’t budge one bit. She was willing to take any consequence, wouldn’t talk to me about what we could do to make it better or more comfortable, and wouldn’t even consider a reward. She really dug her heels in. 

I know I made the mistake of going to a place that wasn’t specifically a pediatric orthodontist and she has a consult at a new place next week. How have other parents worked with their children through these spikes of anxiety? How can I help her talk to me instead of shutting down? She’s always been a strong willed kid and has always been really bonded to both parents. My husband has tried with the vaccine with no luck either. 

My mother in law was a nurse & is Type 1 diabetic so she’s offering for my daughter to giver her a shot and maybe for her to prick her finger so we ca work through these feelings w/ patience and in a safe place. I do think a different environment and staff trained to work w/ children will help, but any advice is appreciated."

There are plenty of solution for setting a *schedule*, say, only 4pm-5pm. No good.

Parenting,children social media,ojyoli,My teen sons have been mad at me for months over a social media post,"I have a popular Facebook page where I post about Parenthood. I'd posted a list of things about raising teen girls, then I posted one about raising teen boys. I have two teen daughters (17 & 19) and two teen boys (13 & 15). 

My sons read it and got upset that I made a better list for girls. I'll admit, the ""raising teen boys list"" was less..... favorable (common things like “boys are gross” “boys are smelly” but not in those exact words). They got all worked up about it and started being cold to me and their sisters, only talking to their dad. I deleted the posts yet their still mad.

That was two months ago. They are still upset. I'm concerned, have I permanently ruined our relationship? What can I do to fix it?"
Parenting,children social media,10kusfa,My 11 year-old son has already been sucked into an anti-LGBTQ gamer hell hole,"Hi there, I just learned that my 11 year-old son has both Twitter and Reddit, and was disgusted at what I saw. Several anti-LGBTQ replies on random posts from queer folks, including a message like ""Hitler/the Nazis would have shot all these guys"".


Obviously, I'm to blame here, for allowing too much unsupervised computer time. When he's been on his Chromebook, at least when I've been around, it's always been just YouTube gamer stuff. He plays games online with some of his school friends and they chat on Discord and stuff. Yes, I'm naive. But I've never, ever, disparaged anyone of these identities, and I've given the best explanations of sexuality, gender as a spectrum, and all that that I can. His mom, who has the kids half time as of a year ago, is moderately conservative, but I don't think she would teach him these sorts of things, even on accident. So it seems to me that these online spaces, like Discord and whatever friends, unfortunately have a better sway on him than I do. Which, I guess, is the big danger of modern parenting.


I think at this age, he doesn't really know the true extent of what he's saying, he's only 11. I'm a millennial parent and I had an edgelord phase as well, probably around the same age, that I grew out of, but I really want to steer him out of this. I'd like to think he's just being edgy, trying to get a rise out of people for fun. However, I don't know what to do here. I haven't confronted him about any of this yet. My knee jerk reaction would be to take away all devices for a long long time and cancel all social media accounts, which, will probably happen, but that doesn't address the sick things he's saying. Has anyone had to deal with this?"

Parenting,children social media,zec5pr,Is it time to tell my 12yo daughter about the violence I endured from her father?,"My (42f) 12 year old daughter wants to move in with her dad, 400 miles away. We separated when she was 6 weeks old and I have been a single parent ever since. I also have 2 other children with him (17m and 14m). He has had barely any contact with the children for 8 years and got back in contact with my eldest via Facebook, and has since had regular contact with the children since then. (He contacts them directly through their telephone numbers as he does not have my number or know where we live). He has only started paying child support in the last 7 months, nothing prior to that.

During our relationship he was an alcoholic, violent, mentally and financially abusive. Not to the children, just to me. It took Social Services threatening to take our kids away for me to get out of the relationship. I have largely hidden this from the kids, apart from my eldest as he remembers things.

However since my 12yo has hit puberty we are arguing a lot, and she has said she wants to live with her Dad. Since he has been back in contact it turns out he has a long term relationship and seems to have changed. I initially said ok I think that is for the best, as I thought she was using the threat to emotionally blackmail me, but since then I have told her I don’t want her to go and she is adamant she wants to. Her dad has agreed. It would mean her moving 400 miles away and living with someone who was previously violent.

I would never want to prevent her having a relationship with her dad under usual circumstances, but she will be 400 miles away and if things go wrong it is going to be a struggle to get her back.

I have tried to protect her from my past up until now, but I am considering telling her what he was previously like, as a warning for her to take into consideration in her decision, or whether this would be highly manipulative on my part. I am also concerned about just saying “No you’re not going” with no explanation, as this may lead to resentment from her towards me, and tarnish our fragile relationship further. 

Any advice would be welcome."
Parenting,tablets,107kweg,What are some tried and true methods of getting kids to take tablets?,"My poor 6yo boy has been diagnosed with Strep A today and was prescribed antibiotics. Apparently there’s a shortage on them so they couldn’t give me the liquid, only the whole tablets. He’s never taken tablets before. They said I could crush them so for his first dose I crushed it and put it in some apple juice. He couldn’t stand the taste so he only drank about half of it, if that. 

His 2nd dose is coming up soon and I’m thinking of crushing it and putting some calpol on top as he has a fever spiking again anyway, but I don’t know what I’m gonna do for tomorrow. I rang the doctors back up and they got a pharmacy team to ring all the pharmacies to look for the liquid version and they rang back saying only one pharmacy had them. My sister was going to get them as my partner was at work and just before she left I thought ‘I’ll check that it’s ready’. Turns out it wasn’t. They only had one bottle left when he’s prescribed 4. And they couldn’t give me the one bottle for tonight for some stupid reason, so I have to ring back up tomorrow at 11 and hope with luck they’re back in stock. 

Until then, I need to continue with the tablets and I was wondering what other methods I could try? He’s a fussy eater as it is, and he hasn’t been eating or drinking much anyway because his poor throat and tongue is just too sore ☹️"

Parenting,tablets,10696ue,Fire Tablets for < 5 yos,"Did anyone else get these tablets for the holiday and find them impossible to use and to curate the images the kids are exposed to?  I am generally biased since I am more familiar with the Apple/Ipad/Iphone ecosystem.  But these tablets claim to have lots of parental control but honestly I find their interface hard to use.  And I wish there was a way to put the apps/videos you want and leave it at that.  Instead you have to be worried about all the selling/searching kids can do and it's a free-for-all.  You can limit time spent and purchases or paid downloads but otherwise the kids are free to download whatever is ""free"" amazon puts in front of their faces - even after the ""age restriction"".  The apps they recommend for the youngest ages are crazy - lots of make up and salon or beauty focused apps that only reinforce impossible beauty standards.  

It took me a while to do, but under the parental dashboard I had to click on my eldest kids' profile, then click the settings (round cog icon), and go to ""kids+subscription content"".  I then search things like ""salon, nails, beauty, dress-up, make-up, wedding, fashion, hair, princess, make-over"" and then you can click on the person icon/age button on the right, and remove those apps from your kids profile.  (TBH I also limited my kids access to Calliou and Blippi mostly for my sanity)

There's just too many apps to find everything (and also there's so much good content why fill their screen time with garbage and toxic stuff) but if anyone else knows of garbage apps or keywords I should search so I can block I would really appreciate it."

Parenting,tablets,10kavb3,Tablet or chromebook for 6yr -- your experience?,"I have \~$150 in Lenovo rewards to spend in the next few months (so I could wait to check sales a bit). I'm thinking to use it on either a tablet or chromebook for my almost 6 yr old. Right now she has an old ipad mini--she shares with younger one, plays some games like the osmo spelling/math/coding. What should I get?  
(1) tablet (starting $150+) --androidOS would be better for apps + games  
(2) chromebook (chromebook duet $380 w 8gb--the duet allows you to use screen like tablet but it's still chrome os so android apps may not work well from what I briefly read)

From your experience, which one is best for her next few years? While chromebook will limit game/app use (ex. Osmo app doesn't work), chromebook will be a better laptop learning transition--learning to type and to use a laptop. We do still have that old ipad mini (that's getting increasingly less useful as it age) but she shares with the younger one. Not sure if there's popular apps I should prioritize a newer tablet for.

I suppose if necessary I'd get both eventually, but which to prioritize?"

Parenting,tablets,y4nqnf,Should I Get My Kids a Tablet,"My kids are both young, one in JK (4 y.o.) and the other in SK (5 y.o.). I am thinking about buying each of them a tablet for Christmas. The primary reason will be for educational purposes; we are considering a few different apps like ABC Mouse (other suggestions welcome, we are in Canada). But also for them to watch their videos/cartoons and music. They get about 2-3 hours a week of screen time each week but we listen to music quite often. I intend to have them do about 30 min of education most days of the week so I figured a tablet would be the best and most convenient for the kids to use. 

Are my kids too young to be getting their own tablet? If not, anything suggestions for any good android tablets? I am current looking at the Galaxy Tab A8 and the Lenovo Tablet P11 with the G90T. 

Thanks in advance.

Edit: definitely some mixed feelings about this but I appreciate everyone's perspective as it definitely seems to have it's pros and cons. My wife and I both work full-time very demanding jobs. It can be difficult to find the energy after work to go through lessons and even finding resource material, so I am hoping we can get done support from some of the educational apps that are available. My kids don't know how to use tablets so I would be setting them up and will be there with them as they work through their lessons. 

My approach will be to allow them to get comfortable with technology and for them to understand that it can be very useful but there are dangers that they need to be aware of. Just like everything, moderation will be key."

Parenting,tablets,yupyxy,Biting the bullet: tablet for a 4 year old,"I have two boys. A 4.5 year old and a 1.3 year old. This refers to the older one.

Since he was a baby, we have tried to limit screen time. He watches some TV, which has been identified as appropriate by us (parents). For example: Disney's Winnie the Pooh, Number blocks (BBC), Blippi (although I'm not the biggest fan), and Duggie (BBC). We have developed clear communication so that he knows that he needs to turn it off, after 2 or 3 episodes. He gets about 30 minutes of TV a day at most. He does not meltdown when asked to turn off the TV.

He has never had access to a smart phone or tablet. I have always felt that once he does, there's no going back.

So, now is the time we are thinking about getting him a tablet. We have a long day flight (14 hours) coming up and we feel that a tablet would help keep his attention and help minimise any boredom on the plane, in addition to colouring and other activities. We also think it would be good to give him access to phonic apps and number apps for learning.

I am hesitant about having him be able to access the internet, but I think I could preload the tablet with appropriate videos and offline learning/gaming apps. 

Any advice on the type of tablet and what to think about before giving it to him?

Looking for thoughts on platform: iPad vs Amazon Fire Kids vs Amazon Fire Kids Pro?

I have heard that the Amazon Fire Kids gives much better parental controls, but I'm also nervous about starting a whole new ecosystem since we already have iPads in the house. Also curious about access to apps like Disney+ and Netflix etc, particularly does it give access to multiple account levels (ex she loves Finding Dory but it's not available for Kids in Disney+ and needs to be accessed on one of the parent accounts. Will we be able to switch accounts to give her access to that? etc?)

I know I'll probably get hit with a bunch of comments saying ""don't get a tablet"" but the reality of the world we live in is that she will be using tablets in school when she starts Kindergarten in September and we want her to be fluent in the technology that she'll be using as part of her education.

Parenting,tablets,xgrw02,Tablet in school might be a problem.,"My daughter just started kindergarten a month ago, and while I expected a big change in her, I wasn't expecting outright mean-ness, lying about everything, and constantly picking on her little sister at any chance she can get. She's always been high drama, but now I dread evenings and weekends because of her behavior. 
Today, she snuck her tablet out, which I hid very deep within my closet. I can't let her use the tablet because every time she has in the past, her behavior just changes and it's almost instantaneous. 
I found out through my husband (who is an administrator at her school, and has access to all of her test scores as well as being able to see what programs and learning games she is doing on her school-issued tablet) that since she is in the top of her class, during group time she is basically just handed the tablet and they let her do math or reading games while the other kids who need more help get hands-on interaction with the teacher. More than 30 minutes each day it seems.
I'm not upset about the classroom dynamic. We knew it was going to be an issue beforehand. And I have a couple ideas I might be able to ask the teacher to incorporate instead.

Parenting,tablets,z9sb6z,Looking for a recommendation on a tablet for a 5 year old.," 

Hello! I came to Reddit because I was on Amazon last night looking and got pretty overwhelmed. I was thinking about upgrading my daughter's tablet for Christmas this year but I don't know anything about tablets. She LOVES playing games (like Minecraft) but her current tablet is something she's had since she was about 3 (a gift from her grandma), I don't even know the brand, and it no longer holds a charge. To use it, it has to be constantly plugged into the wall. I think it only has a bit of space on it because after we put Minecraft on there, she can only have a few other games. The good thing about it is I swear the thing is indestructible.

Anyways, I guess I'm asking if anyone has any recommendations for a tablet that holds a decent charge, a lot of space and a recommendation for some kind of case that helps with accidental falls and whatnot. Also, price is a huge factor, I really want to keep around $150 range if possible but it will be her BIG Christmas present."

Parenting,tablets,ypw6ko,Tablet without a million pre-loaded apps,"Hi all -

I just purchased an amazon fire kids tablet for my daughters, 3 and 5. I occasionally let the kids play a game on my phone/tablet as an incentive or to get them to zonk out for a bit when my wife and I need some down time. I bought them kids tablets cause I wanted to stop handing out my own electronics.

Anyway, while my wife and I were setting up the tablets last night we realized that the Fire comes with a million preloaded apps. They play up all the parental controls, but then don't give me any control over what apps are available to my kids, only that they are age appropriate. I am not worried about any individual app, but it is just such a crazy overload of stimuli and choice. 

I'll likely end up returning them to Amazon. I'd ideally like a tablet with a couple of apps--one or two games and maybe some music. I guess I am looking for something more akin to a normal ipad but with better parental controls. Does anyone have suggestions?"

PBS Learning Channels,
Kurtzgeast, Veritasium and similar youtube channels,
Khan Academy,
Youtube videos of educational lectures (Indian teacher on youtube explains), 
Wikipedia,
Cosmos,
Dictionary/Thesaurus/Grammer sites,
Educational podcasts,
Ebooks (or ideally educational ebooks only, not comic books),
Maybe TED talks,
Biology/Medical Videos/Lectures,
Academic Journals,
Other free online educational resources etc,

Ideally the tablet also comes with some productivity apps like a to do list, calender, perhaps email etc and does not allow more apps to be installed

Basically the software would have a curated list of websites and apps that it could access, everything else would be blocked. Perhaps even the option to allow educational games but limited to a total of two hours per day.

Ideally this curated list could be open source and monitored so that it could be expanded to include more and more educational resources and apps over time. I am willing to fund a linux/andriod distro with a curated list like this as well. My hope is to try this with my kids and if it seems successful and the device works well, there is an orphanage in Mumbai that I donate diapers to that is full of children with lots of free time that really value education and are eager to learn to who I would love to donate these devices,  and if all goes according to plan, get approval from the Gates foundation to expand this to other orphanages worldwide as well. So please message me if working on something like this interests you.

Would other parents be interested in something like this for their kids? 

Does anyone anywhere make anything, any software or hardware that I could use to do something like this?

Parenting,tablets,xjamd7,Was the covid tablet a mistake?,"About two years ago when Covid hit I gave my 2 year old a tablet (I KNOW). When Covid came about, my college switched to online only, and his babysitter quit on me. I'm a single mom, and no one in the family would help me, or watch him for me (Okay fair, whatever I guess). At the same time, when school made the online switch, my professors all of a sudden decided that busy work was the way to go. So needless to say, if I wanted to pass I had to find a way to make it happen. 

I was 100% against too much screen time and this boy had TONS of toys and things he could interact with. His main thing has always been my attention though, so he made it impossible to do any schooling, he's never played well by himself. 

He took an immediate liking to the tablet though (because it's like crack to children). Fast forward two yesrs later to today, and now it seems worse. He's either all up in his tablet or all up in my face. There's no in between. He doesn't really play with his toys at all anymore, and he sits there and asks me a million questions a minute about his new obsession he's learned about from his tablet. He's obsessed with Roblox (which is literally the most nerve-wracking thing on the planet to me). If I'm trying to clean, cook, or anything and he doesn't have his tablet he will sit there and purposefully get in my way, or whine until he gets my full, undivided attention.

I feel as if this isn't something a 4-year old is supposed to do (because I was also an only child and I WANTED to play alone and be left-alone to play and be by myself). I feel like the tablet has caused behavioral issues as well. I'm at a loss, and I have no idea what to do."
Parenting,tablets,y8zcum,HOW DO I TEACH MY 3 Y/O TO USE A TABLET??,"Lord have mercy this is the most frustrating thing i've done as a mother! My mom got my 3 year old son a tablet to play games on and watch videos and HE WON'T FREAKIN WORK WITH ME!! He won't use his finger tip to touch he only uses his nail so it doesn't work. When i try to show him to use his finger tip he'll touch it but not hold and drag. He keeps grabbing my hand and making me do it for him and thats literally the opposite of what this tablet is for. How do i get him to understand he has to hold his finger on the screen for it to do anything

Edit: i really couldn't care less how yall feel about him having the tablet in the first place. I asked how to teach him not for parenting advice."

Parenting,tablets,vts3xv,How to let child listen to music without tablet/device access?,"Our 12yo would constantly be on a device if we let them. Seriously,  constantly. (And addiction runs in the family)

The latest tactic is claiming they ""just want to listen to music."" Well of course I want to allow that! *But* ... that devolves into scrolling youtube and watching a bunch of music videos. 

This might be a fine use during their screen time, but they're using the music excuse all the time, and complaining about ""can't even listen to music"" if we say no.

SO, **how can we allow LISTENING to music without giving access to a device**? 

Thanks for suggestions"
Parenting,tablets,ri1a45,For parents gifting phones or tablets this holiday season. Understand parental controls.,"I lost $16k USD in approximately 8 days, because my child played Monster Legends on an Apple iPad. 

I am posting a copy of recommendations that I have come up with to help you avoid my fate.

Long story short, exposure to technology is great for kids, but for those of you buying or gifting iOS or Android devices to minors this holiday season, here are some words of advice:

If you use Family Sharing with Apple, you will be forced to put payment information on the primary device. So either do not use Family Sharing with minors, or follow some of the advice below.

Also, with family sharing, and the delays that often exist between a purchase and Apple sending receipts to you, or charges to your payment method, if you have valid purchases on one device, and unauthorized purchases on another, they will often get bundled together on receipts and charges. This makes disputing the charges more difficult, because the bank cannot see the number of purchases that make up a single charge.

* Make sure that all parental controls are enabled. If you make a mistake, and your child purchases game content on the tablet, both Apple and PayPal will likely consider that authorized activity.

* Apple makes the process of approving purchases difficult, once those controls are on, and you may have to disable them to purchase anything for your child. DO NOT FORGET TO RE-ENABLE THE CONTROLS. 

* If you upgrade a device that had controls enabled, do not assume that they will be enabled if you are restoring the device from backup.

* There are forms on Apple’s site to report unauthorized purchases by a minor; but, most in-app purchases will not be considered refundable. And, Apple will provide you no information on why a refund was approved or disallowed. You can appeal a denial, but you will likely just get another denial a day or two later, with no detail.

* Set up a small dollar credit card to direct all purchases to. If there are unauthorized purchases, you do not want to use a high limit credit card, or worse, a bank account through PayPal. 

* Apple and PayPal provide no abnormal activity warnings. You will get receipts from Apple and PayPal, but again, it is unlikely that you will get a refund. 

* Based on similar stories I have seen online, Apple puts the responsibility on you to stop the purchases before they get excessive; so do not filter Apple or PayPal receipts in your email. Make sure you get active alerts for any purchases or receipts.

* It is also likely that if you are using a bank account with PayPal, your bank will not provide any abnormal activity protection either.

* Worse, if you use a PayPal account and have multiple funding sources, PayPal will automatically fall over to the second source, if you are using a credit card which does detect abnormal activity, and your primary source rejects the payment. So, they will continue to drain your accounts dry.

My recommendation is to avoid using PayPal for device purchases at all costs. It provides no protection for you, other than hiding your credit card number, and like Apple, they provide no detail if they reject your claim. At least in my case, it does not matter how quickly you identify the purchases. Once they are made, you have no recourse.

Unfortunately, it seems that purchases through PayPal that fall back to a bank account also lose protection that you may have with a credit card, so again, the bank will likely deny your claim.

I assume Google Play is similar, but I have not used it.

Remember, as far as Apple, PayPal and the Monster Legends developers are concerned: any activity that occurs on a device you own is authorized. Side note: Roblox developers do support refunds, which is much appreciated.

Don’t run into a ruined holiday season and upcoming child’s birthday like my family is now going to have because of a simple mistake in configuring your device.

AMA about how to protect your account, and based on my experience I will try to provide guidance. 

I am posting under an alt, because I am embarrassed, and depressed, and now have to explain to a child why his birthday and Christmas are ruined. Don’t be me."
Parenting,tablets,xgvndi,Trying to break the tablet obsession,"I have an almost-4yo. We got a tablet for long car rides when he was 2 and having some carsickness issues (grandparents live 12 hours away, so it’s a long car ride). Well, quickly the “just for the car” tablet turned into the one thing he loves more than anything. Almost 2 years later, he gets limits on his tablet time every day to play age-appropriate games and watch movies, whatever he chooses that’s within the parental controls we’ve set. He’s actually learned a lot from the games he plays, as most are educational (thank you, PBS Kids), and we steer him from the pure stimulation stuff available on there. 

He’s currently having an issue with daily headaches, and while we try to pinpoint the trigger, we’re trying to back off severely the amount of screen time he’s getting. Needless to say, telling him he can’t even have 15 minutes with his tablet is leading to some epic meltdowns. 

Aside from breaking his obsession, we’re having an issue with what to put in its place when we need the time to get some stuff done around the house (I was a TV kid, so I have no problem with him watching TV, but that has to factor into the headache stuff). 

He’s an only kid, so my husband and I have been his only playmates at home. We got him a Toniebox for his 3rd birthday, and he likes it, but it doesn’t hold his attention very long. He’s not quite doing independent play with toys yet, and he’s not very into art (always wanting to art direct us instead of doing it himself). 

Any other ideas? We love playing with him, but he’s a high-energy kid who needs constant stimulation and needs to do some of it independently."
Parenting,tablets,zy23e3,Neglect,"Is it considered neglect to leave my 3 kids (10.,6, 2) alone in the room, with door closed, so that I can walk to the living room to grab something?

Yesterday I was doing just that and my ex-partner came down the hall yelled at me about how it's neglect and how she should record it to show I'm abusing my kids. 

So I would like a peace of mind as to if that's neglect because I do it a lot. I leave them in the room to go cook dinner, my partner is usually in the living room working so it's to keep the noise down. It's never been a problem then but last night it was.

Any time I've gone to check on them they are all laying on the bed watching tv or tablets. The younger one will through craft stuff around the room but they aren't in there for hours and if it is a while im walking back and forth feeding/checking in on them.


Edit: 

New situation. 
Baby and I were in the kitchen because she likes helping me cook. I turned around to put something in the sink and she put her hand on the burner. 

Texted my ex and started getting called neglence and ""I know how you are"" talk.

Parenting,tablets,r83ss7,Daycare using tablets,"Hi all, needing some advice on our daughter’s daycare situation. Our daughter is 21 months old and when we enrolled her, we were specially told kids under the age of 2 would not be watching any kid of tv, shows, etc. Well,  over the past month, when my wife or I watch our kid on the app, the kids are all sitting around a table watching shows on the tablet. My wife talked to the director of the daycare about this and the director verified the toddlers should not be watching shows on a tablet, that the policy hasn’t changed, and that she would talk to the teacher. This was last week and it it happening again! We’re a bit frustrated as it seems like the teachers are using this instead of actually playing and teaching the kids. We picked this daycare specifically because of their curriculum (which did not include watching shows). It’s costing almost $1400/month for this daycare. Just wanting some insight if my wife and I are wrong to be angry and keep pressing this issue with the director.  Thanks in advance."
Parenting,tablets,ybedmm,Tablet for infrequent use worth it,"Hey all, as Black Friday and cyber Monday approach, I was thinking of purchasing an Amazon kindle (or similar kids tablet) for my two year old for Christmas. 

I’m not sure if I want to have to subscribe to the Amazon kids subscription. I know it’s not much but we already have Netflix and Amazon prime and we plan on (hopefully) only using the tablet for travel and when we go to things that have mostly adults in attendance (we have a lot of child free friends who always invite our kid to come along). 

We do travel a lot but is getting the tablet worth it without the Amazon kids subscription? Can you do anything with it? Would an ‘adult’ Amazon fire be the same thing?"
Parenting,tablets,vyk4xn,"Child having meltdowns over tablet!! (Minecraft, Roblox, etc.)","Okay guys I desperately need advice. My son is 5 and became really interested in Minecraft and Roblox after he downloaded it a few months ago while at his grandmothers house. I’ve learned to play both of the apps with him to understand it better & see the positives. They’re fun games, I admit. My issue is every time he has to put the tablet away, he has a meltdown. Every time. The duration of these meltdowns vary but it’s stressful for us both.  Tonight I thought about just getting rid of the tablet until weekends to avoid this but I think you all may have more productive advice. How should I approach these meltdowns and tablet time? 

Things I’ve tried: 
1. Giving him 1 hour per day which he can earn more time or lose time based on behavior and activities (this is new but I’m iffy on this method) 
2. Setting a timer so he can see how much he has and giving frequent updates + Having a transition activity (which he rejects) 
3. Letting him just play all day, no limits (this did not work at all obviously) 

He is starting school next month which I hope will help naturally but for now he is home all day while I work. Any advice, tips, things I’m clearly doing wrong? Can’t put every detail in this post so ask if you need clarification on anything."
Parenting,tablets,10gx1o5,"""No."" ""Why not?""","It's driving me nuts. 

""Mama, turn on the space heater.""

""No""

""Why not?""

Maybe because it's already warm enough inside? I try not to do the ""Because I said so"" thing, but seriously. Because when I give an answer, he has to pester and push and keep repeating the same f***ing question. 

""Mama, can we go to grandma's house?""

""No, it's too early.""

""Too early? Why not?""

""I literally just gave you answer. Grandma is busy right now. You need to wait.""

""Oh, need to wait? Why? Grandma is busy? Can we go to Grandma's house?""

The time in between when he wakes up and when he goes to bed are just full of inane questions that I cannot for the life of me figure out why he's asking. Why is he asking for pizza at 8:30am? He doesn't even like pizza. Why is he repeatedly asking me for a toy *that is currently in his hand*????? Why do I have to repeatedly tell him a rule that he already knows? No, you cannot have your tablet, it is 8:30am and you haven't even had breakfast. He *knows* this rule, so why is he asking. I have never broken this rule with him, so why does he think ***today*** would be the day he gets his tablet before he eats?

I try to answer as many questions as I can, but seriously, sometimes I think he's just asking to see how irritated he can make me in the morning. 

I am definitely not a morning person. Never have been. Him being ready give a full dissertation at 7am does not mesh with me needing 20 minutes to figure out my place in the universe every morning."
Parenting,tablets,we808r,Nanny is obsessed with buying tablets for our son.,"A few months ago, our nanny bought our 1-year-old son three kids tablets (we told her she didn’t need to buy him anything, but appreciated the gift). They make animal noises, play music, etc.  He didn’t show much interest in them so, after a few months, we packed them away with some other toys more suited for when he’s older. 

Every day since we put them away, the nanny asked where they were and “if we threw them out.” We explained that we packed them away and that he has plenty of other toys to play with. 

Last week, the nanny showed up with another new tablet. She explained that she bought it because “we can’t find the other ones.” Our son still has no interest in it and wants to play with his trucks, but the nanny keeps trying to push the tablet. 

Is this weird? How do we explain that he’s not interested in tablets?"
Parenting,tablets,sy2jzw,Grandparents bought tablets after years of me telling them no,"I have a 5 and almost 4 year old. Ever since my first was 2, my mom has been asking if she can buy her a Kindle Fire. I have always said no, I do not personally want my children to have their own tablet devices. I do share my Nintendo Switch with my oldest and my youngest has her own Switch Lite. I planned on getting the oldest her own Lite sometime this year. (both my husband and I are into video games and wanted to share that hobby with them) I do give them time limits on the Switch or we play as a family.

This weekend my parents took my kids for a few days, they live a little under 2 hours away. They complain the girls are bored in the car, so I sent them both with one of those magic drawing pads to entertain themselves.

Well when they came home today, my dad admitted to me that they purchased both kids their own tablets ""for the car ride only"". I told them I was honestly upset that they did not run this by me but they just feel SOO BAD that the girls are bored on the ride. I believe being bored is good for children every once in a while. I said they have to keep them at their house. I wanted to look at them to make sure the games they had on there are appropriate and not just youtube. So of course after I hand the tablets back to my dad, I hear my mom telling the girls ""sorry, mommy says you can't have them here"". Way to make me the bad guy.

We had a blow out with each other once because she doesn't understand why I am okay with the Switch and not the tablets, and that tablets are ""educational"". I understand I appear as a hypocrite, but these are my decisions and I feel it was wrong of them to be sneaky and undermine me. They know I am unhappy about this, I just don't know if I should drop the issue and move on or tell them how I really feel.

UPDATE: I called my dad and told him how I felt. I was very firm and explained how him undermining my parenting set a bad example for my kids and I warned him if him and my mom ever did something like this again, it would not be wise. It had to be the quickest phone call I ever had with him, he usually will talk my ear off but all he did was assure me they would return them to Amazon and then hung up. Thankfully my husband was very supportive of me in all this, he was not home to see it all go down."
Parenting,tablets,ty8o06,"My (23f) other half (23m) has started taking sleeping tablets, we have a 9 week old baby?"," I want to see what other people think, I can’t fathom it. The tablets are Mirtazapine prescribed to him months ago and he has used them for over a year on and off because he has trouble sleeping, and he takes one before bed, they send him right to a deep sleep, he is basically a zombie and doesn’t wake up off them fora good 8-9 hours sometimes longer. 
He also becomes a very talkative sleeper and starts kicking his feet about and being physical. They also make him wake up in an even worse mood. 
He hasn’t been taking them since our baby arrived because (DUH?) baby needs feeding every 3-4 hours. But he has wanted to, he’s asked me if it would be okay, my dad had a strong word to him that he can’t be doing that it’s not fair on me because I will be doing 100% of the night feeds and having no help from him, and then parter has to go to work. 

He is giving me so much stress because I said I don’t feel good about him taking those tablets. There’s been times he’s on them and kicked me while asleep or punched me and not remembered because he’s dreaming about fighting someone. So there’s that.

For reference he works in a betting shop it’s not as if the job is something he should be this stressed about, he said he wouldn’t get another job as that one is ‘cushy’ he can go on his phone, have smoke breaks, yet he comes home absolutely up the wall and needs to go for a smoke of pot first before even helping me still and recently he comes home and says “I need to go to bed I’ve been at work”.. 

I’m so upset because I don’t mind doing night feeds or even everything but I’m beginning to look over at him in bed and resent him, I feel like it’s unreasonable to act that way and unfair on me. So I let him sleep of a night and he moans to me how tired he is, he tells me he still didn’t get a proper sleep because he gets woken up by the baby too, im just the one that gets up. then he goes to work and when he’s home he can’t take over for another hour, or even not at all sometimes. 

I’m getting so fed up I may as well be a single parent, it’s putting downer on our relationship because he took the baby for 30 mins when he got home the other night and says to me jokingly “you can have him back now I need to go for a smoke” so I said “oh had your half an hour, have you” and he didn’t talk to me. Then he called me a bitch and said I’m a nasty bully to him. Then he went to smoke and I found out he was texting his friend how I’m a bitch and I make him feel sh*tty about himself with my comments. He continued to call me a bully the next morning. 

I don’t think I am, I think he didn’t like me calling him out for not helping me. It shouldn’t be helping me he should feel obliged to take over and do his part.. 

So this morning I’m finally fed up, I went to bed with the baby about 3am and he comes up after and goes asleep, he wakes me up by kicking around his feet and sleep talking. He does none of that unless he’s had a sleeping tablet, what do I do? 

I’m sorry if this isn’t the right place to post."
Parenting,tablets,wv4io8,Tips for Tablet Time,"I’ve reached one of the days I’ve dreaded most as a parent - the introduction to the tablet.

My dad bought our son (3) a tablet a couple months ago to help with his at-home learning. It’s nice, and with him being non-verbal, it helps with communicating with his mom and I. The problem is that he is completely addicted to it.

He could stay on that tablet all day until it dies if we allowed it, and when we take it away from him, he has the BIGGEST meltdown. We try to distract him (even put what he was watching on the tv), but that hardly ever works now. We’ll hide it, but then he’ll take our phones and access that. Hiding my phone especially is hard, since I use it for work. 

Any tips for how to maintain tablet time with a non-verbal toddler on the spectrum? Really any advice is super appreciated. I feel like we brought a curse on this household"
Parenting,tablets,upy9u9,My daughter traded her tablet for a classmates phone at school?,"My daughter (9) had electronics day at school yesterday where the kids can bring an electronic device to play on. She ended up trading her tablet for another little girls phone. So she brought the phone home yesterday, but she wasn’t gonna tell us about it (we would have found out) and she asked her little brother (7) to keep a secret which he said they aren’t supposed to keep secrets from us and ran to tell us. Should we punish her by keeping her tablet from her for a little while? Or should we just have a talk with her about not doing this again? My dilemma is that she knew she did wrong because she tried to keep it from us.

Edit: I did contact her teacher and the teacher said that she tells them all the time not to trade devices. I was able to get in contact with the other little girls mom and met her this morning to trade back."

Parenting,tablets,10ry54s,5 year old girl becoming defiant at school/mean to friends,"Hey gang,

&#x200B;

Got a message from her teacher today; LO just turned 5 in January. Teacher said LO was stirring her yogurt but not eating it (not terribly surprising to me) but we do usually stir up the yogurt before eating it. Teacher assistant asked LO if she was done and LO smarted off to her. 

&#x200B;

Teacher also mentioned she hasn't been playing/speaking nicely with her friends lately. 

&#x200B;

LO has been suffering from upper respiratory stuff since forever, we had her on a medication that was supposed to help deal with the symptoms but there was some recent research out that said some kids may suffer from side effects - depressed mood, etc, so we took her off of it. We hadn't noticed TOO much but she has been defiant / rude to her grandmother, who is her usual caretaker during the week when we're working. 

&#x200B;

Her little brother recently turned 1.5, and has been a handful, so he's getting a lot of extra attention of course, because of the fact that he's a toddler. I'm sure that's playing into it. 

&#x200B;

To be 100% truthful, she gets too much screen time. YouTube - usually gaming channels and family vlogs, I haven't seen much of what she's watching that is directly objectionable - and her tablet/Roblox on the laptop.

&#x200B;

After discussing with her mom what we should do, we've decided that less screen time and some time devoted exclusively for her each day should help. Personally, I'm fine with 100% cutting her off from YouTube, and overall restricting her (and our, to be fair,) screen time down to a more reasonable level. It's hard with her little brother, but they're worth the effort. 

&#x200B;

Do you have any other suggestions to help out? Experiences?  Our overall plan is, as stated:

More dedicated one on one time for her

Less screen time overall

&#x200B;

Any other suggestions? Thank you!"
Parenting,tablets,1096pd4,Should I get my daughter a phone so that she can be more social?,"Storytime:

My daughter (11F) had a sleepover birthday party this past October.  It was our first one to host and it went rather well. We had 4 girls come, all of which are considered her ""close friends."" Everything was going well and they were having fun. SUCCESS! When it came time to open presents it didn't take long for the other girls to be practically ignoring my daughter opening presents while they were on their phones.  I speculated that they were even messaging back and forth between each other during, which I thought was super rude, but didn't say anything. Other that a minor incident with one of the girls being mean, things went relatively well.  The girls seemed happy and said they had fun.  As time passed since then, it seems like they have been talking to her less outside of school.  She has a tablet with Messenger Kids on it which is her only way to contact them unless I message their parents.  I'm worried that not having a phone she can use to text them is causing a rift in the group and I don't want my daughter to be left out.  Alas, I have reservations about getting her a phone at 11. She hasn't really asked for one so I'm not in a huge hurry, but if this will help keep her friendships then I'm open to the idea.

What's an appropriate age for a child to get a cell phone?  
What are some rules or boundaries you would set when giving them one?"
Parenting,tablets,10s4ya5,What does your kindergarten look like?,"I toured my daughter’s (5) zoned public elementary school in preparation for her starting kindergarten in the fall and I was alarmed by the kindergarten classrooms, though I liked all the kindergarten teachers, whom I met briefly. The classrooms had no play or learning stations, there were no toys or materials out for learning or play, the bookshelves had only 4-5 books. The classrooms had tables, a rug, lots of posters, tablets, and that was pretty much it. 

18-20 years ago I tutored and volunteered in kindergarten classrooms and they looked a lot different then! There were art, science, math, dress up stations and more. There were times during the day for free play and kids could move from station to station, but I’m told the kids only get 20 minutes of free play here a day during recess. 

Is this normal nowadays? Do kindergarten classrooms no longer have toys or allow time for self-directed learning and play?"
Parenting,tablets,zkydsd,Children being home alone.,"My ex husband is wanting to let our kids be at his house alone until his girlfriend gets home. The kids are 6 and 8, they walk to his house from school (3 blocks, you can see it from his front door), they get home by 3:30 but she wouldn't be home until 5-6 but honestly it's not always set and she could end up being over, she works 15-20mins away. He's a firefighter so he's gone 24hrs at a time. 

I've left the kids stay here when I ran down the street to the gas station for something, but it's never been longer than 10-15mins. 2-3hrs I feel like is a long time to be home alone at those ages. I know he's left the kids to run to the store but again not longer than 15 or so minutes. They don't have phones but they do have tablets that have the ability to call us but what if the power went out and they didn't have internet?

I live 10mins from them, my mom is down the street from them. I just..I don't know.  But at what age is appropriate? The town is really small, less than 1000 people, but I'm worried about choking or an injury and then not being able to get a hold of who they need to. 

I was thinking I'd be more comfortable with them home alone longer than a few minutes closer to 12..but maybe that's being too strict lol 

Just looking for insight.

Quick edit to add some things:
There aren't any laws about leaving kids home alone in our state. DCF has guidelines that say 6 and up. With that said. 

I've already told him no :) I voiced my above concerns and some that were pointed out in the comments and he agreed to keep our current arrangement, where I get the kids on days he can't and he either picks them up from school the next day or his girlfriend gets them from me when she gets off work. 

I'm sure he'll ask again once summer rolls around but same answer lol he can wait a few more years. :)"
Parenting,tablets,10rz7fk,Really struggling at dinner times,"Posting here for some advice.

Little boy recently turned 4 and for the last month solid at dinner time in the evening he's an absolute nightmare for getting hi to eat. 

And it's the only time as well, and normally only for me and my wife. Eats breakfast fine, toast, cereals, pankaces , whateve it is he eats it, same normally with lunch, some fruit, sandwiches etc, eats pretty well.

But no matter what, at dinner time regardless of what we try to feed him he just refuses, will do everything in his power, tiny bites that's barely a crumb, kicking off and crying, screaming, sitting in the huff. Every single night.

A little context of our setup, we sit at the dinner table for pretty much all meals, he's not allowed tablet time or toys during times of eating (to easily distracted). We involve him in the prepping of food, letting him pick his own plates (there coloured ones), picking his cutlery, and in some cases the food he eats, we understand he won't always like what we eat but we at least try to get him to try it, he's a very ... If he don't like the look of it he won't touch it child. But on the plus side, loves fruit and veg, proud my kid would rather eat carrots and lettuce than sweets. Of which he gets sweets but not much and it's limited. 

Id never say I'm the world's best dad but I try to do my best but trying to remain calm is really wearing thin. For the first couple weeks I was calm, never raising my voice, trying to talk to him, convince him to eat. On a few occasions just ignored it to see if me not making a fuss would maybe let him do it himself. Nope just sat there. Moving on past the first few weeks of the endless screaming because he didn't want to sit at the table we broke tradition and allowed him to sit on the rug with his dinner, tried to make it like a pick nic

 Nope same stuff again and again .

So moving onto the last few weeks, works been stressful, long hours, I'm out of whatever calm I had left, I try the firm approach, telling him he's not moving from the table unless he eats, shouting over his screaming so he can actually hear me. And... Well I'm not surprised it didn't work. Sat there crying, refusing to eat, tiny nibbles , one night sat there for nearly 2 hours before I gave In completely. 

We made changes to his routing giving him lunch and.breakfadt a little earlier, lowering portion sizes for lunch times, thinking ok he will be hungry now. Nope didn't work.

When he goes to grandparent house, rarly an issue, eats a whole load of stuff he won't eat here, fish, macaroni, chicken etc.

So my conclusion is somehow we are the problem, but I've yet to figure out.... Why. I've done the nice guy part, I've been what I call the firm dad, and eventually the bad dad out of frustration and sheer exhaustion.

No other Meal does this happen, all the things I've read online state to get them involved, he helps make the dinners, seems to family enjoy it, but won't eat it.

Does anyone have any suggestions or advice that might help me retain my sanity and help change this terrible eating time routine"
Parenting,tablets,ts9c32,Hesitant over buying a tablet,"I will be traveling alone by plane (5-6 hours each way) with my 2yo and almost 4yo in a few weeks and I’m not sure if I should get the oldest a tablet. It’s also her birthday around that time so I could even swing it as a gift so it’s not really an additional expense.

I always figured I would wait at least a few years before getting them a device, because so far the only screen they have been exposed to is the tv and we’ve been managing it well.

On the one hand, I know it’s probably going to be much easier to keep her occuppied on the plane if we have one, but on the other I’m scared it might become a habit and for me she’s still too young for this to be an everyday thing.

My husband is leaning on not getting one yet, but he acknowledges he won’t be the one dealing with two small kids alone on a plane so completely supports my decision lol. So I guess I need some outside advice on this!

Edit: Thanks everyone! I have decided to get a regular Amazon Fire with a kid safe case as a “family” tablet that I can take out for specific occasions only. We are pretty good at setting boundaries and maintaining them so I’m sure we’ll find a way to make it work. Your comments have reassured me that this is something that works for many of you so it makes sense.

I just want to add that I do have other activities/toys planned for them, I was just wondering whether to add a tablet to my arsenal!"
Parenting,tablets,10g44au,Anyone else doing unlimited screen time while sick?,"Over the past two weeks, my two year old has had so much screen time that it would make your head spin. But she just felt horrible and didn’t want to do much, naturally.

Then I got sick. And me being reduced to tylenol/benadryl only due to pregnancy has me shamelessly throwing a tablet my child’s way. Yes I’m going to reeanact that episode of Bluey (whale watching I believe it is) and put up with however much blippi my child begs for.

Will I regret it when we recover? Most definitely. Am I regretting it today? Absolutely not.

Screen time parents, I’m with you!"
Parenting,tablets,10ema7f,The public school Kindergaten standards seem crazy high.,"My 5yo has a May birthday. She is in a class with a lot of kids who are already 6 or are turning 6 before her. She has recently been diagnosed with ADHD but currently has no official accomodations, just what we have personally worked out with her teacher. She is not medicated.

Last year, she attended preK from 8am to 10:30am 5 days a week. They were very education oriented, everyday was about ABC's, counting and numbers, however, she wasn't learning a whole lot about them. I wasn't worried, I was more concerned about her making friends and learning social skills, which she always got high praise about. She did very well in this class and was happy to attend most days. Because she didn't get to go to preschool when she 3 (COVID), I wanted her to go another year. Full day preschool gets naps and my daughter still desperatly needed them. Unfortunatly, the policy in our school district is that 5 year olds have to go to kindergarten, and it's been rough. So far we have had issues with adjusting without a nap, dealing with big emotions and solving conflicts with other kids. A lot of these issues are due to ADHD and we have been working on them. So far I feel like she's been doing really well, going longer and longer stretches without crying in school and making lasting friendships. I also noticed that she can now read a ton of words, add and substract up to 10. When she comes home, she is able to do her take home work with little to no help.

However, according to the school, she is still ""behind."" Every month the teacher sends home a set of 20 sight words that we are supposed to go over with flashcards, which is not an ideal way for my daughter to learn. I have done my best at making it work for us and downloading sight word games to play on her tablet, which she loves and learns from all the time. She is improving in her skills at a steady rate. When I got her reportcard, which doesn't have letter grades but rates their knowlage by number (1 beginning 2 developing 3 proficiant 4 advanced), I was expecting a 3 on her reading and math skills but instead I saw 1s. Confused, I sent the teacher an email asking for what standard these kids are being held to. Apparently, by now, my daughter would have to know 80 out of 100 sight words to get a 3 on her reading skills, 50 or more for a 2 and under that number is a 1. I almost spit my coffee out. I asked all the moms i know in kindergarten what their kids got and no one got a 3 in reading, only a handful got 2s,  For math skills she needs to be able to count to 100 accuratly, add and subtract up to 10 without props but they may use their fingers. I did a bit of googling and found that these standards are more approriate for first graders,

I think it's really unfair and unhealthy to try and push these little ones to be so advanced, I thought it was just my kid because of her ADHD but according to what i see in other places, kindergarteners are still learning to count and recognize all their letters, with only 20 sight words as the goal for the END of kindergarten. I am in no way suggesting my kid is a genius unrecognized. In fact, we don't plan to make grades or ""Ratings"" a big deal as long as she is trying and progressing. I'm just worried that this is all too much and that is why she had been having such a hard time. If standards continue to be too high for her and her low marks start effecting her self esteem, we may have to consider homeschool if thats how public shcool is going to be.

&#x200B;

Edit: It seems that some are misunderstanding some things. Yes, I realize that most kids don't nap in kindergarten, I am not complaining that kindergarten doesn't nap. I wanted her to be in preK for another year SO she could nap but the school doesn't allow it. Yes she has now adjusted to having no nap during a normal day. 

As for her diagnosis, I have emailed the teacher with the doctors official diagnosis letter and she said she will pass it on to the right people. I haven't heard anything about it since. I was planning to contact the school soon so see what is taking so long with the IEP. 

Lastly, I know this is normal school standards. My question was more about other parents opinions on the standards and if any other parents had kindergateners that struggle(d) with stress because of them. "
Parenting,tablets,10e2pew,Too much device consumption,"I'm starting to despise the amount of time my kids spend on their devices. I know i am at fault for letting it slide for too long but It's ridiculous and so normalised these days. We buy them game consoles/tablets/mobile phones because we know it's the future, so we can keep in touch (teens), help with their learning, homework and technology skills (young ones) but the amount of time they spend on gaming, social media, posting for 👍💕👀 And the things they are consuming is toxic 💩. Plus, they are becoming like zombies on it.

My eldest used to love to write short stories and draw, now all she wants is to post silly dances to YT. Iv'e always kept things to private but since she got a phone for her 11th bday, she is in loads of group chats and just wants to 'perform' and become a Youtuber. My youngest 4yo, just wants to watch videos of other people playing online games..WtF is this lool? 
And i get it, it's highly addictive, reasons why i no longer entertain FB or Insta. I swear them sites were impacting my mental health, and Fk TikTok.  Not to mention when the devices inevitably Break down, My kids have a mini break down too, expecting a sudden refix or renew as if Foods and Bills don't come first. 

So, Iv'e decided to ban devices for a few hours a day and replace it with reading books, craft,  drawing or painting for an hour a day (After school) at least. Is it just me who feels this way regarding our kids and their devices?? Any other suggestions are welcomed. Wish me luck mamas and daddos 🤞🏽.

Edit: We do plenty of outdoor activities whitch they love too..pending the weather. Parks, nature walks, visitsing farms, picniks, bike rides, seaside holdays etc. Im just referring to cold season when stuck in the home."
Parenting,tablets,v827n6,is there an app that turns a tablet into a kids tablet?,"Right now I have these two android tablets that were advertised as ""kids tablets"". They're just regular-ass android tablets with this app cake Kidoz. I kinda hate it. It's riddled with ads, it's supposed to allow access to other approved apps through it (which barely works), it's supposed to lock the kids out of the rest of the tablet without a password, but regularly fails... I just... Uuuggghhh...

I love the idea of an app that allows kids to access approved apps and basically soft locks the tablet. Just have like, YouTube kids, Disney +, learning apps and games, but they can't get to like, messages or chrome or settings, you know?

Does anyone know of an app like that that *doesn't suck*?

Parenting,tablets,10juzo4,Nearly Threw Our Xbox in the Street,"Feeling pretty guilty right now. 

Have two well-behaved boys, ages 5 and 8. They, of course, always asknto play video games. But they're both very active and like playing sports. Usually before allowing video games, they have to do something physical (play catch, shoot hoops, etc), so I don't mind. 

But the 5 YO will on occasion throw tantrums when he loses a game (it's what 5 YOs do). He gets video games taken away until he can act correctly when it's time to turn them off. It's a process, but we're getting there. 

The 8 YO always asks me to play. He asks multiple times a day if I'll play a video game. He can be obsessive about things, so I try to be patient and tell him no thanks, but I can tell he's disappointed and sometimes he'll say, ""But you haven't played video games with me in X days!"" Which makes me feel bad, but I don't change my mind because I don't want to reinforce bad behavior.

Also, the 8 YO is hyper competitive. So when we play, I have to play against him. He's not interested in cooperative games. I hate playing competitive games because I either have to let him beat me, which is boring and he knows what I'm doing. Or if I win, he cries because he lost. 

So tonight, I agree to play a video game and don't want to play against him. So we do a thing in the game that takes longer than expected and he starts whining. Like dude, you beg me to play and when I do, you complain. The 5 YO keeps.trying to get me to log into some game BS and I told him no five times. Then the 5YO throws a tantrum about it being time to end games. While he's screaming, the 8 YO says something like, ""it's not fair, I didn't get to play what I wanted.""

I think my eyes rolled into the back of my head at that point. And I lost it. I grabbed the Xbox and tablet, announced I was throwing out so some other kid who doesn't complain can find them, and walked outside and almost threw it all in the street. I ended up putting it in my trunk and coming back in and the 8 YO is now on my old phone watching YouTube, which is not remotely allowed. So then I actually yell and send them to shower. 

And now I feel guilty. But man, video games have broken me. I mostly needed to vent here a we're getting the 8 YO therapy to help with his hyper-competitivness soon (which might be tied to some insecurities, which is why he's very clingy with me). I wish I didn't yell, but I don't regret yanking that dang thing out of the wall."
Parenting,tablets,10inv7a,"At what age did you realize your children were too old for things like ""seeing santa""","This year was the year i realized my kids were getting too old for certain things...They're 8 and 10 (both birthdays this month, so more like 9 and 11 basically) . And up until two christmases ago, they loved going to see Santa. They loved if i took them anywhere that was Christmas-y during the holidays. There was a christmas drive thru event nearby. It was basically kids dress in pajamas and blankets in the car and we slowly drive though our local fair grounds which was decked out to look like a christmas wonderland. Lights, music, displays etc. They really go all out for the kids. So i tell my kids about where we are going expecting them to cheer like they normally would. But this year without ungluing themselves from their tablets go ""oh ok..yeah sure"" We get them ready. Heck, we swing by a McDonalds for them to get a treat to eat too. I'm patting myself on the back, i'm such a great mom lol. But my kids are still like...eh, this is whatever.

We get there and they don't look thrilled. They look out their windows and occasionally point to a display that might not be properly put ""i think that reindeer had too much eggnog.."" followed by giggles. I go ""oooh ahhh, this is neat right guys?"" ""It's ok.."" My son being the oldest is more sarcastic and goes ""oh boy this is really greeeaaaat..."" ""i'm bursting from excitment....""

We reach a part that is meant to be Santas village. I ask if they want to talk to Santa, both go ""nah..that's ok"" ""NOPE!"" But i guess we didn't have to get out of the car because Santa comes walking towards us, just in time to see me rolling down my window and both my kids do a ""jesus, he's coming this way"" And both put the blankets over their heads hiding from him while laughing like crazy. As Santas standing right by the window peering in, my daughter lets out a scream. Poor guy gives them a confused look before moving onto the next car behind us. I hear the kids in the car behind us going ""yay! its Santa"" and squeeling as little kids do. I hear that then turn over to glance for a moment at my older children.. The did the same thing to someone dressed as the grinch coming their way, hide under the blankets laughing maniacally.

We reached the end and make it back to the road. The entire ride home they're just laughing at how lame it was, how scary it is to have people in costume come up to your window..lol..Meanwhile im sitting there thinking to myself, how did i not know that they're too old for this stuff...like did i really think they'd love it as if they were still 5 or 6? Not going to lie, it made my heart hurt for a bit. Though i think they bonded during all that so that's a win i guess. I was going to take them on a Santa Train ride thing the week after but i decided against it. I didn't want to embarrass myself with these two making sarcastic commentary the entire time. Plus i didn't want to ruin it for the other parents there with their babies. We don't belong in those places anymore. Guess i got two pre-teens now."
Parenting,tablets,10gt9vn,Have you created email addresses for your children?,I recently got my children tablets and it difficult to find email addresses not already taken and I guess that will get harder as they get older.

I've heard of it as a way to preserve things for them for when they're older but I'm not sure how true that is anymore.
Parenting,tablets,10hh4xv,My 5 year old drew a disturbing photo of me (26) and her sister (7) unalive,"I’m really concerned and don’t know what to do. In part, I blame myself. I allow her to watch too much YouTube as I work from home and her sister is at school, I don’t have much time to be with her at all times. Recently I have her in daycare for two hours a day while I go to the gym so she can spend time with other children.

Today her and her sister were drawing together and they both came to my room to show me what they drew. Her sister drew a typical photo, trees, nature, mountains and the sun. To my surprise my youngest shows her photo and whispers to her sister “it’s you and mommy dead” and said it very causally with a little giggle. 
I saw the photo and immediately my heart sunk. 

The photo was of me and her sister. The background colored black with me and her sisters eyes ripped out. We had blood all over our shirts and we were both crying. The image was very dark, just red and black colors. On the chest of one of us was red speckles (as if we have been stabbed) it was truly terrifying. 

I asked her why she drew this and this made me worried and scared. She responded with first, being silent. Then when I brought her up to my bed to talk about the drawing she just cried. I hugged her and told her it’s alright and she’s not in trouble. I told her I just wanted to talk about the picture. I got nothing from her and she basically cried and closed her eyes and kept crying til she fell asleep in my arms. I don’t know what to do. Has you child ever done this? Does it mean anything ? Am I overthinking? The one thing I know for sure is YouTube and overuse of her tablet is banned."
Parenting,tablets,zpa2j6,Exhausted and no time to myself,"The days seem so f*cking long as I’m trudging through them but, come bedtime, when I reflect on my day, I have no idea what I’ve done with my time, like it’s some kind of blur or time warp. Kids wake up between 6:00a-6:30a and go strong without naps until bedtime. Honestly, sometimes all I can really remember doing is fielding a million demands/requests, cleaning up behind my kids and every neighborhood kid that has spent the day here yet the house still looks like shit, chasing my dogs down the street multiple times when they bolt past whatever kid is walking through the door for the thousandth time, blah blah blah…

I have no time for self care or quiet. Trying to type this took me nearly an hour due to the consistent interruptions and requests and my 4-year old jumping on me. Even in that I felt guilty for being on my phone for those few minutes and just begging for “a few minutes of quiet” because they are just wanting my attention. The kids love being with me and that makes me feel freaking amazing to be so loved but, also makes me feel like I’m selfish to even have these feelings/thoughts. Whenever I leave the house, at least 1, if not all 3 have to come and I don’t have the heart to say ‘no’. There are times where I do sneak out the door, but my kids start FaceTimeing from their tablets upset that I left without them.

Parenting,tablets,vcy6tr,Tablet Time vs. Sibling Bonding Time,"I'm torn between not wanting my child glued to a tablet all day, yet being happy he has a way to stay close with his sister. 

SD is 9. ""Ours"" son is 4. SD is having to do summer school because Bio-mom insisted on homeschooling her for the last 2 years because of Covid - we were on board for the year before last but thought she should return to in person last year, but DH didn't want to fight with BM. Anyway, BM wanted to do it all herself and didn't send any of the work or curriculum when SD was here. Now SD is so far behind in math, she has to do summer school. Not really sure why it's so hard to teach 2nd grade math, but whatever. 

We usually have SD for the whole summer since BM doesn't live close and every other weekend visits would keep SD in the car for a pretty big chunk of time. Since SD has to do summer school, she can't come until June 26.

Our son absolutely adores his big sister. He thinks she hangs the moon and stars. It's really cute. She loves her little brother, too. So pretty much all evening and for a good amount of time on the weekends, they're video chatting through messenger kids and playing roblox together. 

Is it really so bad for him to be on his tablet so much if that's his only way of interacting with his sister?"
Parenting,tablets,zbwp6j,Why do we do this?,"The last few weeks have been rough. I traveled with my kids on a 7 hour drive, we did thanksgiving at my wife's families house and drove home the next weekend on another 7 hour drive. The whole ""vacation"" was just... work. My wife's family hasn't been getting along. Her mother passed 2 years ago, her dad started dating again and wanted to introduce us to his new girlfriend (she was lovely, but my wife was super uncomfortable, understandably). She has a younger brother that has special needs and will for the rest of his life, that responsibility will eventually become our. Not a big deal, you do for family what you must, but it weighs very heavy on us. 

Anyway... We get back home Sunday night and it's a mad scramble to get all the chores done for the week, we've both been away from work and when we get back it's going to be a lot of work piled up. Kids are restless, they did nothing but play and sit, eat food, pies, watched their tablets. The whole week is just going to be hard, getting them back into a routine, getting healthy food back into the rotation, it's all just exhausting.

The work week goes on, and things fall into place pretty nicely with the family. Kids are tired and hungry so they're eating good food without a fight and going to bed a reasonable hour... But work is harder than I anticipated. It's like no one did anything while I was away and the also waited until I was back to add more work. I'm just beat at the end of the day.

But today was good, my oldest went to a friend's for the weekend, my wife went to brunch with a friend. It's just me and the 5 year old. We go to lunch and the park we have a good time, play really hard for a couple of hour, but I'm getting wore out, it's time to go home, fix a snack, and relax. The five year old is having non of it, she still has energy, I ask her to just let me alone for 30 minutes, but she is relentless . I'm getting annoyed, frustrated, grumpy. I force her out the back door to fend for herself.

Luckily, she finds something to do. A hulahoop thats been outside for years she starts playing with, and it's now quiet in the house.... FINALLY!! I decide to read a little, something I can get immersed into, something that will let me escape and relax for a bit in the silence. I get my kindle out, turn it on, and start diving it. Then I hear it, she's crying and whining because the hulahoop broke, of course it did, it's been sitting untouched in the sun for two year. She comes in tears in her eyes asking me to fix it. I tell her ""No, it's broken. Find something else to do.""  She starts a tantrum . I get frustrated tell her she hasn't touched that toy in forever, she should just throw it away and do something else, anything else, just leave me alone.

She walk out of the room, tears growing in her eyes. I feel terrible, but also vindicated. I deserve some me time, I deserve to be left alone. I just want a little bit of time before my wife gets home and I need to hear about her day and friends that I barely know and fain interest about her friends colitis. Then I hear something else, the five year old is at my desk. The one place she's not allowed to be, the one place she isn't supposed to touch anything. I take a deep breath and head down stairs, peek my head around the corner.....post it notes all over her hulahoop.

I keep my growing anger under control ""What are you doing?"".... She looks up at me, frustration now in her eyes ""I'm fixing my hulahoop.""... I'm so proud of her. She took the initiative, she had a good idea she just didn't have the right tool. I take her to my work bench, we epoxy the tube together, wrap the whole thing in colorful electrical tape. It's like a new hulahoop. She's happy, ""Thanks dad.""

""No... Thank you."" We hug, and I got a few minutes alone before I hear my wife's car pull into the garage."

Parenting,tablets,10ggex8,How do I get a 4 year old to sleep earlier?,"I live with my ex, who I care for and has a 4 year old daughter from a previous relationship. I care about them both dearly and would like some advice to help the daughter create healthier habits, such as going to bed earlier.

Currently, she sleeps around 10:30PM to 12:00AM, usually falling asleep in front of a tablet watching YouTube videos. She's very energetic so exercise might be the obvious option, but my friend is a single mom and by the time she comes home and picks up her daughter from pre-school, it's 6:00PM. The daughter obviously wants to play as long as she can before she goes to sleep, but I know that 11:00PM bedtime is *very* late for a 4 year old and I want to help because it obviously has a toll on everybody.

Please correct me if I'm wrong, but I think the general consensus is that 4 year olds should go to sleep at 9:00PM. How do we change her bed time?

I was thinking, slowly make her bedtime earlier bit by bit. For example, if she currently sleeps at 11:00PM, have her sleep at 10:30PM for a week (or longer?), then 10:15PM the next week, then 10:00PM the next week, etc. Would 15 minutes earlier each week be realistic? Or is that too fast?

If we try to put her to bed at around 10:00PM, she would cry and not want to go to sleep. It almost seems pointless putting her to bed that early at the moment because she would probably cry until 11:00PM or so.

Any advice or feedback would be very much appreciated.

&#x200B;

As a side question, how do I bring this up to my ex? I almost feel like I do not have the authority or 'right' to tell her what to do as a parent, as we are no longer officially dating and I have never been a parent before. I ask for advice because I genuinely care for the both of them and I can already see the late bedtime affecting them both negatively, and I know a late bedtime like that for a toddler can have much worse consequences in the future. 

Thanks in advance."

Parenting,tablets,10dnx5c,Need advice/insight about my son (7) who has decided he hates school and refuses to go,"My son is 7 and in 1st grade. He's like me, he's into technology, science, and video games. He is smart, gets good grades, he reads above his grade level and is above grade level in math. I'm not trying to make it sound like more than it is, plenty of kids are as smart as he is, but he's certainly not challenged in school. He has always been stubborn in certain ways. He doesn't want to do what he doesn't want to do.


An example from early childhood - we never could get him to go to sleep on his own. Once he got in a ""big boy bed"" he'd just leave his room no matter what we tried. We could physically put him back in, but he'd just get out again. Over and over for hours, until everyone involved is angry. Eventually we lost the battle of wills and just started laying with him to fall asleep. We still do that some nights although we sort of resigned ourselves to it long ago, it's actually not that bad. I'm just trying to illustrate this part of his personality.


At some point we started letting him play video games, mostly tablet and then Nintendo, and he loved it. We have 2 other kids and it could be such a valuable tool sometimes to occupy him. We've played together, and he loves playing with me, we bond over it. He bonds with friends over it.


I think over the last few years we let it grow beyond a healthy amount. We've always had occasional transition problems because of it, e.g. getting him to turn it off to leave the house, but from what we hear from other parents that is super common. It has recently rocketed past that.


Just before Christmas, he started suddenly and aggressively refusing to go to school. When we ask him why, the thing he most consistently says is that school is boring and takes up too much time. When asked what he'd rather do, he says video games. We've ended up needing to take him kicking and screaming. All last week was like that.


Last Tuesday, we removed all video games. And starting on that first day he certainly showed addict behavior in terms of lashing out. Any time we try to talk to him about it he refuses to see video games as a reward or priviledge for going to school and doing well, he only sees it as we've taken them away. Oddly, the majority of the time he has been fine. He's started playing with regular toys more, he will still watch some TV, he's started playing outside more, he's gotten a little into chess, etc. But when the topic comes up, he has not really come around. He is saying now that he will go to school tomorrow even though he doesn't want to, but we'll see. I will not be surprised at all if he refuses.


We've tried to question him to find ANY other reason that could be related to this, and it does seem like there may be some social issues happening too. He has said school is ""overwhelming"" and that he sometimes thinks other kids are distracting, or he can't make friends with all the kids becuase there are so many. But trying to get deeper into this gets inconsistant answers and he certainly doesn't stress it as much as ""school is boring"" or it ""takes up too much time.""


The school staff is supportive, and will help us get him in the door and into class. They've tried talking him. They've told us that they do see this kind of thing with a few kids per year. But they are not telling them anything he's not telling us in terms of what the problem could be. Just that school is boring.


I always liked school, because I was good at it. He's good at it too, but doesn't care about that part. He doesn't want to do well the same way I did. When I think about worst case scenarios, this year could easily be the beginning of him just never caring about school. It's very stressful and heartbreaking to me.


I feel like we've royally fucked up navigating the whole video games thing, and have somehow created this nightmare scenario without realizing it. It all seemed fine until a month ago. We're going to continue to keep video games away and frame it as he has to ""earn them back"", but I don't even know if that is the right approach. Does anyone have advice or insight from a similar situation that might help?"
Parenting,tablets,y99gxk,Screen time can be a blessing,"I know so many frown upon using iPads/tablets/electronics with their young children, but man am I so THANKFUL for their existence when I am sick af. I have never experienced anything quite like this stomach flu before but let me tell you how much it SUCKS and how grateful that my child understands that Momma needs rest. If that means handing her the iPad for the evening with finger foods for dinner, so be it.

Parenting,tablets,zkez1e,4 year old claiming she wants to stab herself.,"
*to preface, we have made an appointment with a developmental pediatrician.*


Today, while casually sitting on the sofa, my 4 year old said she wanted to get a knife and hurt herself. My husband and I were appalled and asked her what she meant, to which she stated the same thing and explained a little further that she hates herself. 

We do not yell at her. 
We do not spank her.
We do not speak negatively towards her. 

My husband picked her up, held her, and asked her what made her feel that way and she didn’t give a definitive answer other than she hates her family because we get on to her and took her tablet away a few days ago after a violent outburst in a store 

(she had thrown product and had a tantrum in the store full on screaming, raging, and laying in the floor. We promptly left and took tablet privileges away. Was that the wrong thing?)

She has a history of pretty bad insomnia, violent outbursts, frequent outbursts, doesn’t respond well to gentle redirection, she sleepwalks, she won’t eat half of the time though we beg her to. She is defiant to a point of excess and I don’t know how to work with her. We’ve asked her pediatrician before and he said it was just a phase but I am beginning to feel that there is something severely wrong.

I never thought I’d be scared for my child’s safety like this.

Has anyone else experienced behavior like this? What was done?

What can I do while we wait for an appointment?

I’m in the United States, is there any emergency services we can utilize for her mental health?"
Parenting,tablets,y545yy,Ok to check child's browser history,"TLDR: Does checking your child's browser history completely destroy their trust?

I received a concerning message from my 10 yr old daughter girl scout leader, so I sat down and had a talk with her. During the talk I didn't believe that I was getting completely honest answers, so I asked my daughter to bring me her iPad and check her browser history. I calmly explained that I was concerned for her safety. I also explained that I wanted her to feel safe asking me things that she was curious about. I proceeded to check her browser history with her present. (I didn't want to go behind her back and snoop.) I didn't find anything concerning, but she still started to cry. I know I likely violated her trust, but felt that it was my duty as a parent to make sure that she was safe. With how much it embarrassed her, I'm wondering if I did more damage to our relationship because I was trying to do the right thing. I feel like I probably shouldn't have checked it. Thoughts?

Context: her Girl scout leader remarked that she was talking about summoning demons, death and cannibalism."
Parenting,tablets,10ipi8i,Fear of Accidents After UTI,"*SHORT VERSION: 4yo daughter has robable UTI and after 5 days of antibiotics is saying she feels better but still spends a majority of the day on the toilet and is refusing to leave the house. Most questions can be answered from info below.*

Background: Daughter is 4.3yo. First UTI. Potty trained at 3. No accidents day/night since 1st week being fully potty trained. Never shamed by parents for accidents. Just transferred from a daycare to a private school after winter break. PreK/4yr old classroom. 2 female teachers. School teaches preschool through 3rd grade. Only interaction with other grades is at chapel once a week. 

Issue: Called by the school on Tuesday at 12pm. They said my daughter had gone to the bathroom several times and now was refusing to leave the toilet. Also said from the beginning of the school day (8:00am), she seemed withdrawn. 

Looking back, she went to bathroom more frequently than usual the prior day before this started but didn't refuse to leave the toilet.

When we picked her up, we had to force her off the toilet and carry her to our car. Went to immediate care. No urine passing so couldn't get a sample. Hysterics and carrying when pulled from the toilet and brought to the exam room. There she said she felt the urge to pee and her ""vagina felt uncomfortable"". Because she wasn't able to produce a urine sample and was difficult to examine, she was prescribed antibiotics for a UTI based off of symptoms. 

Started 7 day antibiotics Tuesday night. (At home, checked body and vagina. No irritation or redness) Bought pull ups to help with stress from fear of having an accident. Didn't help. Still refuses to get off the toilet for about 10/11 hours out of 14 hours of awake time. Started giving her a tablet on the toilet because, if she doesn't have it, she will constantly call us to stay in the bathroom with her. We cannot do this. Breaks are taken when she eats. Seems to forget about potty. Cranberry juice mixed with water is given at every meal. Plays for a bit and then back to the potty.

We are on morning after the 5th day of antibiotics. Says her vagina doesn't feel uncomfortable anymore. Doesn't feel urge to pee but is still scared she's going to have an accident. She doesn't want to leave the house, even passing on her Saturday dance class. She is already saying she doesn't want to go to school tomorrow.

Parenting,tablets,10behsb,Parenting help,"My wife and I are the parents of a 4 year old little boy and I’m the first to admit I’m probably considered the “fun parent” on my days off we play or go out on some type of educational trip. The problem comes with my sons opinion of my wife.

My wife works 5 days a week from 8 am- 3pm when she picks my son up from daycare. After getting him they’ll head home where she lets him watch tv/ play on a tablet while she takes a nap on the couch. At around 5 she’ll make dinner and then in bed by 7:30-8:00.

My son recently told me he loves mommy, but she never plays with him or has fun she always sleeps. When I ask my wife about it she gets upset and says I’m just saying she’s a bad mom. That’s not my intention, but I want him to have fun and play with her too. Does anyone have any idea on how to get it to her that she needs to play more with him?"
Parenting,tablets,zq6k0w,I feel like I'm failing my oldest,"My (25f) oldest (4m), is a huge handful. He screams, kicks, throws things, threatens people, and just has a lot of behavior problems. It's been this way since he was 6 months old and learn that 'no' ment he couldn't get what he wanted.

 I don't even know where he's getting half of his behaviors. He's 4, he watches stupid baby shows on Disney and Netflix, my youngest (3f) watches the same shows he does. We basically treat them like twins, one child doesn't experience anything different than the other. They have tablets, but it only has Disney, PBS kids, Kids Netflix, and some baby games. They aren't allowed on anything like YouTube without supervision.

 I deal with the kids all day, I get them ready for school, I pick them up, I give them snack, lunch, and dinner, I bathe them, I put them to bed. I'm dealing with them 90% of any given day, their dad works during the day and isn't back until they're asleep. I'll admit I'll get frustrated and raise my voice, or pop my oldest in the mouth when he's threatening people. And I know that's not the best thing to do at all.

 But I have no idea what to do. He'll threaten everyone just because he doesn't get his way, and we've never given into him when he throws a fit over not getting what he wants, so it's not like he's just an escalated spoiled child. He's reverted back to biting people, or throwing things. I just don't know how to handle him. He gets hugs, cuddles, and such when he's behaving, and some rewards like pizza or watching me play a game he loves like Slime Rancher. So we do reward him for good behavior, and either discipline or ignore his bad behavior. But he doesn't stop.

 I made an appointment with his doctor for next week, so I can maybe get some help. I just feel like I've failed somehow, and like I'm drowning trying to help him and deal with him day to day. I don't know what I'm doing wrong, and I just feel like crying. I know I'm not the best mom, but I'm doing my best, it's just not enough.

Edit: They only have tablets for 2 hours before bath and bed. They get them at 7 for dinner, and I take them at 9 for bath and bed. The screen time is already limited."
Parenting,tablets,zz8w76,The Great Debate...,"Hi folks,

This has been a pretty big debate recently and I'm looking for answers. Should children under 5 own or access screen devices like tablets or phones? Why or why not?"
Parenting,tablets,zw3uoa,Gentle parenting.. what do you do about crying (5/7),"Hi- In hindsight a LOT of things my parents did weren’t cool. Lovem, but that’s how it goes. I definitely heard “stop crying or I’ll give you a reason to cry” “stop acting like a baby” mocking for crying, etc.

Obviously I’m not trying to do that. But I feel like there has to be some sort of happy middle ground. Correct me if I’m totally off-base here, but I think it’s totally age inappropriate for 5 and 7 year olds to cry regularly, specifically when told they can’t do something or are asked to stop doing something they shouldn’t be doing. 

Might be how I grew up, oldest of 8 in a blended family. By 3 it was cues to use your words, 4 was scolding, 5 absolutely not if you’re not injured or somebody isn’t dying. There are just other ways to express you’re upset. 

I feel like our kids (my steps) literally WEAPONIZE crying. Like all of the show your emotions, everybody cries, it’s okay to be upset it being used as a card 75% of the time. Loud, whiney, tearful demands complete with stomping feet and slammed doors “ITS OKAY TO BE SAD” “YOU DON’T EVEN CARE THAT MY FEELING ARE HURT.” Whoa. Never said it wasn’t. But we’re crying about pizza rolls. Or not getting tablets first thing in the morning (which literally never happens) or me saying I won’t help them find their winter gear until they search every cubby and their backpacks alone. Or won’t entertain every single “but I was going to” “In a minute” “but pleeeeease I want..” 

Instant tears even if they’re well-rested, had plenty of 1:1 time, food choices, gentle warnings. Terroristic tears. And most of it stops the second they know it won’t actually get their way. Namely when dad leaves the room. If he runs an errand or works it’s basically nonexistent.

How do you balance gentle YES have and show emotions vs don’t become Dandy from American Horror Story? It’s almost like proving whether or not a stomach ache is real. Sometimes you just have a rough day. I have hugs. But we have to not let everything ruin our days all the time. I’m sick of crying as a tool for boundary pushing"
Parenting,tablets,10nk0gj,6 year old putting penis on screens,"My 6 year old ASD son has recently grown fond of putting his erect penis onto screens. Let me explain. He has an educational tablet and will go sit on the toilet or on his bed pull down his pants and hold and push his erect penis onto the screen. Now I have older boys so I know masturbation/playing with can start at very young ages and it is perfectly normally but he’s not fully verbal and I’m beginning to wonder where this is coming from. Today was the straw that broke the camel’s back and inspired me to post. I was making breakfast and he went into my room, turned on his favorite movie, stood on my dresser and dropped his pants. 

I’ve asked my ex husband if our son has ever accidentally walked in on him handling his business. He says no. My husband, their step dad, won’t even do that sort of thing unless the kids are at their dads. I’m at a loss and don’t know whether to chalk it up to a very intelligent child discovering himself or if I need to be concerned something else is going on."
Parenting,tablets,ztpy1t,"Parents who coach, is it bad to have your child sit in the stands while you coach?","My ex-wife has been stalking me when my child is in my custody and taking pictures.

Even other moms hang out with her and sit with her. 

My ex-wife told her attorney that it's not okay that I leave my child alone while I'm coaching. Her attorney said they have pictures of my daughter sitting alone and threatened me with contempt if I continue to coach and leave her by herself.

I feel like I can put a stop to this now, as I plan on taking her tablet away for at least a month and if she does get it back she has to keep her door open while using it. I am divorced from her father and I'm skeptical about telling him because I know his punishment is going to be super harsh and he's going to want to sign into her account and see for himself and I know she would be horrified... and I know he wouldn't let her attend this dance she has her heart set on going to. She's a good kid and she didn't send pictures or anything. Am I wrong if I try to handle this on my own and let her know that if she behaves this way again that I'm telling her dad everything? I plan on having along talk with her and establishing stricter rules. She doesn't have access to technology at her dad's house so she can't get away with anything at his house and she doesn't see her boyfriend out of school so they won't be left unsupervised or anything.

Parenting,tablets,xzkkrf,Need to know if I'm being rude to in laws,"Last year my fiancé passed away suddenly, the day we moved to where his family is from. We had a 2 month old at the time. After a couple months I moved back to where my family is from, and since then I have traveled to my in laws 5 times which is 12 hours round trip. They really want me to come and visit more, but with my son being 14 months it is so difficult to make that happen. 

He is too young to color or watch a movie on a tablet to keep him busy, but also too old to sleep most of the way, so he mostly just ends up screaming for a majority of the trip. They want us to visit for the one year anniversary of my fiancés passing and Halloween. I feel like his dad wouldn't allow that long of a trip if I felt it wasn't in our best interest, but I also know that our son is the last living piece of my late fiancé. Am I being unreasonable? 

Also, none of my in laws have come out this way, but they have said they will try to after Thanksgiving. As it stands I usually make the trip every couple of months, but it is so stressful with him screaming most of the 6 hours. I just worry that I am being rude by not going."

He has a 9 year old daughter from a previous high school relationship that he has no current formal custody agreement with. Currently she is with us every other weekend but he is wanting to pursue full custody. 
He and I were brought up in very different houses. My family was upper middle class and his father didn't eat on multiple occasions to make sure his kids were fed. 
I'm finding myself getting extremely frustrated in how we parent. For instance, if his daughter dislikes something that I'm cooking, he'll make something else despite knowing it irritates me. I came from a family where we all ate the same meal, period. He also doesn't pay much attention to what she's doing while she's over. Let's her play on her tablet in bed or watch tv until ungodly hours.

He has been going there since he was 6 months old and all was good until a couple of months ago. A lot of change in the management and the teachers. I have a bad feeling about of the new teachers. She mentioned once my son has a ‘mean’ face - because he didn’t smile to her. Isn’t that a weird way of putting it ? She also mentioned once that he was starting to say some words because he repeated the word ‘MOVE’ when she said it to him (she said it to me quite loud and that made me feel strange about how she talks to him).
Then this week, I arrive to pick him up a little bit early, and I see her showing the kids (all between 1 and 2 years old) a video on her tablet. The video was a kids cartoon. I talked to the director as I was upset, at home we do everything so that he is not exposed to screens and we pay a lot of $ for this daycare, supposedly to enhance his education He said it’s unacceptable and he will talk to her.
And now today, 2 of the long lasting teachers of our son, who we love, announced they are leaving the center. I talked to one of them who said the changes were too much and that she didn’t appreciate the new teachers’ behaviour, shared my concerns and told me that in her opinion, if I keep my son at the daycare, I should pop in to check what’s going on from time to time. 
I am very annoyed and stressed as I just want my boy to be well taken care of and loved even when I’m not there. I feel like the new teachers just do the tasks (change diapers, feed, do activities) but with no love and care and that makes me feel uncomfortable. 
What would you do ? We have an appt tomorrow with the director, I am planning to voice all concerns and most likely look for another daycare asap , or even ask the teacher that we liked who is leaving to be a nanny for us.. any advice appreciated ! Thanks."
Parenting,tablets,10e8dfd,Need advice on 2M and 8F Niblings,"My cousin and his wife are visiting and they have 3M and 7F. The kids have 0 routine, they let them go to bed after midnight, eat whenever and whatever, device dependent and have them both using diapers for convenience (toddler is understandable but the older kid has 0 toilet issues and very bright)

3M wants to eat by himself so my mom cut up some toast and gave him a sippy cup of milk with some banana and he loved it. But SIL only gives him baby food and crisps despite his preference for normal food (no allergies and fine to eat everything except spicy food) 7F is given food and her device where she will nitpick food for over an hour before she will give up and just watch shows on her tablet. Both irritable due to lack of sleep and they sometimes skip bathing them altogether.

It's their kids but this lack of routine is killing us as we sleep around 10.30pm and have early morning jobs. No amount of hints have worked as kids run riot through the house, my pets hate them and they are here for a long vacation. Any tips?

I have other SIL, aunts and my mother who have their kids on some kind of routine and supervision so I know this is not normal. Other SIL's ensures their kids have eaten under supervision and that they finish at least 80% of everything and meal-times are 15 minutes or less. Bedtimes are flexible but never beyond 9.30 pm for under 10s. They also enforce good manners and habits like please, thank you and when to pick up their toys to get ready for bed etc. Any help would be great on tackling this for our sanity. They are not bad kids nor are they naughty, they just lack routine and structure. I have found that distracting them with age appropriate activities have been useful for afternoon play (sidewalk chalk spelling and reading, hopscotch, sensory play sand and water, gardening, colouring, building and drawing, music etc, finger paints, we have a lot of kiddos visiting every now and then so our house has lots of activity options I keep on hand that are not electronic)"

My son got so many toys for Xmas but all he wants is to watch his tablet. I allow a few hours of blue screen time a day but he feels so bored without his tablet. I don’t understand, when I was a kid I never watched tv, I had an awesome imagination. I guess he just doesn’t. Idk if I need advice or just wanted to rant or just was seeing if there are others out there too"
Parenting,tablets,10i1gw0,Bored 5yr old daughter.,"My daughter has trouble playing on her own. She has a bunch of toys and she’s great at playing with them if she has a friend to share them with. We try to encourage her to draw, color, pretend play, or work on crafts, but unless an activity is novel, she just gets bored and doesn’t want to do it. We also try to play with her, but often she just doesn’t want to. My wife and I are especially worried because all she wants is screen time at home. Either the tv, her tablet, or computer. 

Any ideas for how to keep her engaged at home? 

She likes candy land a bunch, any ideas for good board games for 5 yr olds? 

She loves helping us with baking and cooking. 

Any ideas would be awesome!"
Parenting,tablets,109fkem,Screen time,"I’m curious everyone’s opinion on screen time and tantrums/acting out.  

Lately I’ve noticed my just-turned-5y/o has been acting terrible and throwing tantrums and being all around nasty/mean towards her little brother which she’s never done before.

I’ve heard from some people who cut out screen time for a couple weeks how their kids attitudes totally change but with 3 kids (one of which is a newborn) it’s kind of our crutch. We’ve cut it down already and will usually just watch a bit in the morning and then to wind down at night and then she plays Roblox for an hour (we cut that way down too) but the attitudes just keep getting worse…

Just as a P.S. we’ve been trying to watch how we speak and I’ve tried talking to her about it but nothing seems to help. Also I do monitor what they watch very closely, no tv on a phone or tablet it’s always on our living room tv so I know what they’re watching at all times."
Parenting,tablets,tf2vci,tablet for plane travel,"hi there! our family of four (mom, dad, 3-year-old and 6-month-old) will be on a 4+ hour plane ride next month. not sure if you've heard of the movie Encanto, but our 3yo is obsessed, and we are hoping to let her watching the movie on the plane ride. I thought my old iPad 2 (from, oh, 2011 or so) would work for this, but Disney+ does not work on such an old device.

buying a brand new iPad for about $400 feels a little crazy for just this one trip, but I'm skeptical that a cheap $50 Amazon Fire tablet will actually do the trick.

have any of you parents successfully used a tablet other than an iPad for downloading videos from Disney+  to play the movies offline on an airplane?"
Parenting,tablets,nxim1c,Question about tablets,"I have a 4 year old who I would like to buy a tablet for and I am wondering if anyone has found something good. We have the kids fire tablet, but its really slow and there are way too many apps that auto download according to his age. 

I would like to limit the apps to maybe 5-10 educational games and maybe a few kids streaming apps. 

Has anyone found a tablet that works well with limited games/apps that runs smoothly?"
Parenting,tablets,101lofr,Struggling with nearly 3 year olds and defiance,"We’re pulling our hair out over here trying to figure out where we could have gone wrong, and why our twins are completely ignoring us.

Their entire childhood up until a few months ago has been a breeze. Always listening, always sweethearts. No tablets or smart phones, limited television, reading 3-10 books a day, a lot of playtime with our boys, the whole package of “were doing pretty well I think” parenting. Reach a couple months ago and it starts spiraling. 

It started with just straight up defiance. Doing things after we tell them no, over and over. Laughing in our faces after doing something naughty, tearing down blinds in their bedroom during nap time, and refusing to sleep for hours and screaming songs at the top of their voices. I’ve watched as me and my wife’s calm demeanor has turned into quickly becoming hostile and angry. We’re working on that, we’re not perfect, but I don’t know how else to respond to this erratic behavior. 

We just started potty training, they just got big boy beds, so I understand a lot is changing in their little lives and they’re testing us. I get this is probably normal. I just need people to reassure me that it is normal, and that this will end with enough patience.

Thanks everyone."
Parenting,tablets,set3ds,Adventure Academy Alternatives for Fire Tablet,"Hi all, my 7 year old has been wanting to get the Adventure Academy app (ABC Mouse but for older). I went to download it onto her Fire tablet but it’s not compatible!! Ugh!!! Is there an app that is similar to it? I want it to be progressively educational but have that style of interaction that she enjoys. Thank you so much!!"
Parenting,tablets,fywh0k,Finally got rid of the tablet.,"My son is 3.5 and has been addicted to YouTube for the past 1.5 years.

My mother-in-law bought him a tablet against my wishes for his 2nd birthday. I never wanted him to have one, but soon after both my wife and I became used to the convenience of just letting him watch while we got things done around the house or if we went to the store. He was quiet and would giggle at the videos. It was cute back then. 

However, he eventually started to wake up each day and the first words out his mouth were ""Tablet, please?"" and he would go to bed each night asking the same thing while he would fall asleep. I noticed his behavior got worse and worse during this time and he would become very irritated at my wife and I if we wanted to do anything except let him watch YouTube. Instead of simply asking, he was demanding us to give it to him.

Now, I really began to hate him watching when  I noticed that many of these supposed kid/family focused channels are really just platforms for advertisers and contain very questionable content. The unregulated nature is really my issue with it all. I am perfectly fine with him watching TV/streaming because I know the content on there at least has some semblance of a story, life lessons, or educational value and, plus, he doesn't know how the remote works yet so I have much more control over what he watches.

The straw that broke the camel's back for me, however, was about 2 months ago my wife woke up for work at 3:30 AM (she works 1st shift at a hospital) and found our son in the kitchen hiding under the table eating a big bag of marshmallows and watching YouTube. His saving grace that night was that I didn't find him. I honestly don't know what I would've done if I did because I'm sure I would've just have seen red. I really started to limit tablet time to a minimum every day to ween him off at this point.

Fast forward to this whole current quarantine situation. About a week goes by of me working from home and him screaming for the tablet each and every day. I finally said enough is enough and took it away cold turkey. Of course, the first couple days were really rough, but I quickly noticed him playing with his toys a lot more, running around in our backyard, wanting to play pretend, and just be an imaginative young kid. It's like a switch was flipped and I couldn't be happier for the both of us! I have no plans of bringing it back out ever again and I'll be happy to let it collect dust until the end of time at this point. 

Now I know how tough it is to limit screen time, but seeing what I'm seeing now with him I really wish I got rid of it sooner. I can't recommend it enough to just go cold turkey. It's gonna be really hard at first and you'll want to give in a lot, but you gotta stay strong and power through. Believe me it's worth it."
Parenting,child iphone,1057nim,should I make my 12yr old repay?,"For background Grandma (66) has always undermined my parenting.
She is getting better about it, but it used to be really bad. She would sneak my daughter (Kylee 12) candy and treats and stuff her full of all of the junk food her little heart desires to the point it started effecting her health and anytime Kylee wanted something weather it be toys or staying up late and I told her no she could run to grandma and even though grandma knows I said no she would say yes. Sometimes when Kylee would get in trouble for misbehaving grandma would argue with me along with Kylee trying to defend her. 

I bought Kylee an iPhone for her birthday a few years back and wanted a debit card to put on file so she could down load certain apps. I told her she can't use my debit card because she is a child and I don't want any surprise charges on my phone so she goes and asks Grandma and Grandma said yes. I explained to grandma why this was a bad idea but she did not want to listen. 

  Kylee asked grandma if she could get a 10$ monthly subscription to an app using her card, I said no because grandma is on a fixed income and can't afford to pay monthly subscriptions but grandma says yes. This leads to extra charges and grandma having to call the bank and cancel her card. I tell her not to let Kylee add her card to her phone again but she doesn't listen. 

    Grandma let's Kylee add her card to her phone again although I told them both she is not allowed to do this, this time it leads to Kylee signing back up for the 10$ subscription with Grandma's permission and using grandma's card to buy Roblox also with Grandma's permission. Grandma forgets she allowed Roblox (about 50$ worth throughout the month some as a Christmas present) and didn't calculate it in her budget then comes up short on money at the end of the month and cancels her bank card gets refunded the money but has to wait for a new card. Accept for this time I make Kylee Pay back half of the money.

  Well last night not even two weeks after grandma got her new card in the mail I find out she let Kylee put her card on her iPhone again and let Kylee sign up for a free trial on her phone as long as she cancels the membership before her card is charged. Nobody said anything to me about this and now 40$ has been charged to grandma's card from apple because Kylee thinks you cancel a subscription if you delete the app she has no idea what she was doing so after the trial is up grandma gets changed for the subscription. After Kylee leaves to school grandma comes up to me and says she doesn't know how we are going to do this if she should make Kylee Pay for the whole thing or only half. But I don't know if I am going to make Kylee pay her back at all I told Grandma to stop letting my child use her bank card on her phone but she keeps giving it to her anyways what should I do?"
Parenting,child iphone,2sstv5,"Can anyone recommend an iPhone app that tracks your child's immunizations, height, weight, etc?","I'm not having any luck finding one that allows me to replicate digitally my child's health record card the doctor fills out each visit.  It includes immunizations, height, weight and head size."
Parenting,child iphone,56j520,How do you monitor your child's cell phone usage? My daughter 9(f) was just given an iPhone by her dad/grandparents and I'm a little upset,"So basically, daughter's father went over my head and got her a phone on her grandparents's plan. I am a bit upset as I hadn't planned on her having a phone till she was older (and her Dad knew this, but that's a while other situation) but rather than make a thing of it, I just want to insure that she is as safe as possible. I don't feel as though she needs a phone yet, she is always with one of us or with people we know. She also gets picked up and dropped off at school. Buuuut, some of her friends already have phones, I knew it was inevitable anyway and I don't want her to be ""that kid"" with the helicopter mom. She doesn't have a tablet, but is allowed to use my laptop for homework and games with supervision. 

So, first off I've always had android phones and don't know the first thing about iPhones. Are there parental settings I can use to limit or block Internet usage? Second, how strict should I be with monitoring texting and pictures? I don't want to invade her privacy but feel she is too young still to have good judgement with what is appropriate. How old  were your kids when they first got phones? I didn't have one until I was in high school, so I'm a little lost here."
Parenting,child iphone,b21rwj,Need an app to monitor and limit my child's time on iPhone,"I am looking for an app that will allow us to monitor (the more detail the better) and let us set custom time limits for each day of the week.  Showing phone location would be great too. 

I recall a computer program called Golden Eye that would take screen shots every x seconds and log every key stroke. I am hoping there is an app that will allow us to see exactly what my child is doing on tiktok Instagram, etc.

Thanks.!

Parenting,child iphone,yy2iyn,"IOS, macOS, windows, chrome… which offers the best protection for my child?","Currently, my child has an iPhone 8 and I hate it!  She easily bypasses parts of screen time or exploits its glitches; it is quite frustrating.  As of right now, she does not have a computer, but really needs one or a tablet or new phone to do schoolwork on.

My worry is that no matter which or operating system I get her, she will be able to bypass parental controls and access sites she shouldn’t such as discord, and/or use apps when she should be doing class work.  

When it comes to a phone, she refuses to use any phone aside from an iPhone, and screen time is a joke; has anyone had any success with T-Mobile’s parental control apps or any other apps?  I’d also like to be able to switch off cellular network access when needed (I can do the same with Wi-Fi already), if anyone know a parental control for that.  As for other devices, I would appreciate any advice as to which apps and/or OS keep tweens/teens safest online.

Thank you in advance!"
Parenting,child iphone,yee2ul,Am I too strict as a parent? (Throwaway account for obvious reasons),"I, 49M, live with my 48F wife with my 14M and 11F child. We are fully Korean and my children are second-generation. My wife is extremely fallen into religion and living off of evangelical Christianity, while I am an atheist, but we live together decently well. I grew up in a poor family, where food was scarce and education was difficult.  We live in a high-end household, and we manage to live without any financial worries. Recently, my 14M child has been complaining about the living conditions. He complains that he gets no privacy and is never allowed to have any independence, claiming that we're too controlling. We've done everything he wanted. He got a perm(he paid for it), We bought him an Iphone(he was complaining about being bullied for having an android), we bought him a pair of expensive shoes(air forces), and we even sometimes buy him other gifts. He has 2 hours of his phone a day, with music set to always allowed. Locks at 10pm and unlocks at 6am but always allowed apps stay always allowed. His phone privileges will be lost if he doesn't maintain straight A's in his advanced classes. His college funding will only be provided if he gets into a good school like UCSD with a good STEM major. He pays for all his extra things like extra clothes, food with friends, and appearance. My wife wants his phone at 10:30 every night, and I agree with her. He can have fun going out with friends almost every week. He gets all his money off of tutoring, which we control and hand to him sporadically when he explains why he needs it. He always complains about needing more privacy, more independence, and more respect as a person. He's only a freshman, and can have all the independence he wants when he leaves for college. He never wants to spend time as a family, and spends most of his time upstairs. We just want him to have a good life with a good future, but he's too young to understand. Are we being too strict?"
Parenting,child iphone,1huv8m,The iPhone & iPad game I would recommend as a parent of a young child,"It started out innocently enough. We were waiting for a table at a restaurant, my daughter was about two years old and fidgeting. I checked the App Store on my iPhone for a kid's category, found a fake phone game, and let her go to town on it. It saved the day and bought us 20 min of quiet time. Since then I've downloaded a lot of games and educational apps for my daughter (who is now four and a half) and there's only one that has stood the test of time, this is the one that she hasn't got bored of or stopped wanting to play, the one that I don't mind her playing because it's not mindless or violent.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPK_IXv_POI
This is the Ninja Jump (http://bit.ly/10IuEiy) game on my iPhone that we go to when I find myself somewhere with my daughter and we're both bored. This happens sporadically in dentists' offices, queuing up while running errands, and often at a restaurant.
I've tried dozens more and deleted them all when my daughter grew out of them or no longer found them interesting. Ninja Jump has stood the test of time and lasted a couple of years, best of all, it's free.
Though I wouldn't suggest using this game to ignore your child or thinking that you have to use it all the time (crayons and paper are usually a bigger hit than the iPhone) this app has come in handy when there's been dead time to fill and nothing to play with."
Parenting,child iphone,x0fv9v,"Advice needed: How to handle consequences for an incident with my son, 4.5","I need some advice on how to deal with discipline and consequences for an incident this weekend with my son, 4.5. For background, he's been displaying increasingly violent/aggressive behaviors during his tantrums, which are frequent (2-3 a day on average). He screams, hits, throws things etc. and all of it just keeps getting worse and more intense as he gets older. The tantrums weren't too bad from 2-3 but around 3.5 they've gotten increasingly worse over time. They also seem to be somewhat deliberate, for example he's started looking for particular items to throw, not just throwing the closest objects - and usually these are expensive things he picks out (phones, tablets, headphones etc.). We actually just had an appointment with a child psychologist last week to discuss getting him tested for ADHD and/or mood disorders, per the recommendation of the pediatrician, but any evaluations or treatment will take time and I'm getting desperate for answers. We've had a lot of changes this past year with his sibling being born 6 months ago and moving to a new house as well.

The current situation occurred this weekend at a friend's birthday party. Leaving fun situations is one of my son's biggest triggers - to the extent that we've considered cutting back on fun outings and playing with friends because his reactions when its time to leave are so extreme. Screaming, crying, trying to run away, hitting us, etc. Well today he decided to throw things, and threw his friend's dad's iPhone - shattering the back glass on the concrete. I'm horrifically embarrassed and SO angry with him, and also unsure of how to move forward. Obviously there needs to be consequences, and I'm considering making him ""pay"" for part of the phone using some of the money he's saved up from birthday cards etc. to buy a new toy with. I also told him we might not be able to go to another friend's birthday next weekend because he can't behave at them. Are these consequences too harsh for his age? I'm really struggling at this point with disciplining him and could use some honest advice. I don't know if I'm being too harsh or too lenient - am I crushing his spirit by doing this, or am I raising a spoiled brat if I don't? This parenting thing is so damned hard. 

Thanks for any and all advice - I also posted on r/preschoolers. Need all the help I can get!"
Parenting,child iphone,wputj9,What is my 14yr old doing on Telegram?,"Firstly, at present his phone is blocked of all gaming or social apps + internet browser. He’s been caught several times (over the last couple years) talking to strangers on TikTok/Snapchat etc.. dangerously high numbers of strangers so privileges were taken, I had no choice (no it wasn’t innocent chats either. Photos were exchanged) He’s currently enjoying being spoiled at Grandmas for the remainder of summer without the distraction of his phone.

As for Telegram… he managed to convince my mother into letting him use her spare iPhone obviously with nothing blocked. He’s attempted to get back on TikTok… I got an email notification for a password reset ( I made him sign up with MY email). I called him, he lied… “wasn’t me.” A day later my mom sends me a screen cap of a bunch of chats she’s caught him on in an app or internet site called Telegram, clearly strangers + groups chats such as ‘tiktok cuties’. Immediately upon asking him what it was.. another lie. I dunno mom I dunno what that is.. Gave him a chance to tell the truth and he did, admitted he was using it. BUT I asked him what exactly he’s doing on it and how these people ended up on there.. ‘I dunno mom.’

I’m frustrated, I don’t like removing these privileges but he’s been caught crossing many lines including giving his cell number to a stranger. I googled Telegram and it’s basically a text app?

Any parents know more about this app? How does he find these people to talk to, on the app directly? I’m trying to find out how he came across these people in the chats in the first place.. 

On a side note how the hell do I get this kid to understand the dangers of internet strangers? Honestly he’s a good kid and he’s got everything a kid his age would want including his own damn washroom and a mother who goes above and beyond to respect his privacy. I’m a single mom and work a lot so I know this plays a roll in his boredom sometimes but I’m not strict, he has a bus pass. I’ve expressed he’s literally allowed to do whatever he wants with his friends as long as I know where he’s at but he still has little interest in going out and doing stuff…One point to take into account is that he doesn’t have a bestie or consistent friend from what I notice but he’s always talking about doing things in groups at school like volleyball at recess… he’s gotten the internet talks MANY times, I’ve done it nicely and with understanding. I was a teen mom so I’m not the type to be strict and isolate my child knowing what that can create. I always treat him as though hes smart enough to do anything and he’s smart enough to figure anything out, I want him to be confident in himself. I want him to know the real world and learn to navigate it properly. He’s draining my patience and I’m torn between “he’s gunna do it anyway” and “someone is going to swat my fuckin house” 

Uhg. 


TLDR: What is telegram, how is my 14yr old finding people to chat with on it and how do I get him to stop with the damn strangers in every corner of his phone."
Parenting,child iphone,xed6xl,Best cell phone for a tween,"My daughter is turning 11 the end of the month and for her birthday I am getting her her first phone. I don't care what your personal opinions are of when a child should get a phone, this is happening I will feel safer as she is getting to be more independent and this will allow that.

I'm trying to decide the best way to do that, she doesn't need unlimited data to browse the internet but allow her to send and receive pictures etc. I just came from the store where they recommend and iPhone 12 mini (for reference I have a galaxy s22 so I have no idea about iPhone). They told me it's the best for kids as it has the most control features.

So my options are to go with that or a Walmart burn phone where the only controls would be 3rd party apps. To add a line to my existing account would be an extra $100 a month, or I could go with a $30 phone and, what, $50 a month + the price of 3rd party?

Anyone have any experiences with either phone. After 3rd party would it be about the same per month?

I have to run back into work before proof reading so sorry for errors."
Parenting,child iphone,vub9b7,Am I the boring parent for not letting my kid have an iPad/iPhone?,"My ex (25f) and I (26m) were talking about ways we were going to coparent and she told me that she wants our daughter (one and a half) to have an iPad or iPhone and I said no because I want her to experience the world that isn’t enclosed in a screen. She said that she should be allowed to have one to send messages, watch all the shows and play her games. I said if she wants to have one on her side that’s fine, but when she comes over I’m taking it up and taking her outside and letting her enjoy being a kid (I grew up with a dad who didn’t really let us leave our rooms so I didn’t want the same for my daughter) and her response was “it’s not detention you’re just being a boring parent” and I just wanted to know is there a middle ground for that stuff?

Parenting,child iphone,w73uiw,Is cash/gift card ok for an 11 year old birthday gift?,"My son is an only child and he’ll be turning 11. I would not say he is spoiled, but he has literally everything he needs/wants. He’s mostly into sports and electronics/gaming. He has all the sporting goods he wants. He has an iPad, and an older but still good gaming PC he uses for Minecraft which is the only game he really plays. We have a Nintendo switch but he doesn’t use it.  He got an older iPhone as an elementary graduation present and for getting excellent grades. 

We’ll certainly get him some small items like books and some family board games. But I can’t really think of anything else to get him.  When you ask him what he wants he says “nothing”.  We’re taking him and some of his friends out for his birthday to an amusement park. 

I’m thinking of just depositing some money into his bank account. I feel like once school starts he might develop some new interests, or might want a new laptop etc at some point.

Parenting,child iphone,r3ig9y,Is anyone here doing social media / online tech minimalistic parenting?,"Hi community, I posted here a little while ago about reservations regarding video games for our child (still pregnant but my hormonal anxious brain is worried about a lot of things) and after reading all the responses chatted to my husband who is way more liberal on these issues and we came to the conclusion that our child won’t have an iPhone or iPad. They can have a dumb phone at the age of around 8 (situation dependant) to get in touch with us in emergencies and a smart phone at 11 when they go to secondary school so they can be part of school WhatsApp chats (or whatever the future equivalent is) but no closed social media like Snapchat and any other platform like Facebook has to be regularly monitored with us holding the passwords and limitations on screen time. We plan to bring balance through providing other compelling alternatives like sport and music etc, and that was a point of importance for us.

We decided that computer and internet access will be introduced when it becomes important for school and we will vet which TV shows are appropriate from infancy. Video games will be educational only. I see so many posts about kids, and know so many adults who have become video game addicts or spend an inappropriate amount of time playing games at the expense of other things.

I know that it’s a controversial view point but I’d like any guidance, support or lessons learned by parents who are successfully parenting this way. Please avoid creating a debate if you strongly disagree."
Parenting,child iphone,sx995z,I need advice,"Ok so me and my girlfriend have 2 kids together 1&2 and she has a 7 year old child from a previous relationship that I raise with her. So my stepdaughter is in 2nd grade and she received her progress report on Friday which was horrible. Out of 20 categories she’s received a 1 or 2 in about 15 which is “failing or behind grade level” and about 5 3’s which mean “at grade level” and I was pissed. After I show her the progress report and I tell her how I feel she tells me that I need to acknowledge the 3s that she has which were all for gym and art class and that made me get more upset because she didn’t really care about her failing grades. So today she takes her rolling skating and out to eat and I feel like she’s wrong. She treats her like a teenager, she lets her play on her iPhone all day and let’s her stay up watching tv all night until she chooses to go to sleep. I try to implement discipline and structure but without us being on the same page it’s almost impossible. It seems like I’m wrong for caring and I would be a asshole if I washed my hands with the situation and just focused on my children, also I’m now worried that she’s gonna raise my children the same way.

Parenting,child iphone,revbvh,Daughter turned into Iphone zombie,"Our 11-year old owns a smartphone. Giving it to her was a bad decision. She got it a year ago, when all of her friends already had one, and we didn't want her to feel excluded. We chose a used Iphone and installed all the child protection there is, including limited screen time etc. 

12 months later, she has this thing like implanted in her palm. Apple's screen time limits don't work effectively, as she found ways of turning them off (changing system time etc) or using apps that cannot be limited at all (talking to you, Roblox). Even if everything is shut down, I caught her swiping the phone settings or her picture roll for hours on end.
She has a fixed screen time limit of 4 hours per day. When we checked the phone this evening, she had spent 6,5h on the Iphone. 

Our daughter is a happy and smart girl with a lot of friends, but we feel this cellphone ""addiction"" makes her more quiet, more isolated. It adds up with pre-teen behavior like lying in bed for hours with the blinds down (she hit puberty when she was around ten).

We long for a way to effectively cut down on her screen time. Taking the phone away altogether isn't really an option though - she needs to be able to call us up from school, and all the other kids in class use Whatsapp to communicate. We don't want to go that way. 

I am curious: How do you control smartphone times of your kids in this age group? Any best practice here?"
Parenting,child iphone,qugiqf,16 yo refuses to take responsibility for anything,"When something doesn't go right, my 16yo always finds a reason for it, versus taking responsibility for herself.  Really simple and stupid things and I won't go into all the examples, but its a pattern her dad and I have been seeing for years.  What happened this morning is why I'm seeking your advice or comments.  Is this normal?

Situation:  

\-Today she has to be at school early, and she has over slept a minimum of 5 times and missed this early team practice.  I was frustrated because we discussed it last night, she acknowledged remembering she had early practice.  I knocked on her door at 7:05AM and said good morning, and she replied.  At 7:40AM when I heard no activity I knocked again and I heard her wake up, say ""oh shit"" and then came out to tell me she can't go to early practice.  

\-We have driven her to school daily forever.  So my departure to go to work depends on her being ready.  I have a flexible start time, but expecting to leave at 7:40AM and then actually leaving at 8:30AM is frustrating.

\-She has a history over the past year of waking up late and sleeping through her alarm.  We have heard her alarm going off for 20-30 minutes and it seems she just sleeps through it and doesn't hear it.

\-She is suffering from mild-medium depression.  She is functional but does very little outside of school and seeing her boyfriend a few times a week.  She's been seeing a Psychologist and a mental wellness professional for some time, and I doubt she tells them the full story because I don't see any change in her whatsoever.  

\-We bought one of those atomic clocks that shake the bed, she says she tried it once, it didn't work and hasn't used it since.

\-She insists she wants to go to early practice, and that the coach isn't upset about her missing practice.  She says others have missed even more practice than she has.

\-When I spoke to her about being late, she says ""are you mad at me"" and I responded with ""well I'm a bit frustrated that you are missing practice again.  You should speak to Ms. XXX to see if you can make up any of the missed stuff, or can you even still be on the team since you've missed so many practices.""  

\-Her suggestion is that when I knock to wake her up at 7:05, I should insist she come out of her room to take her pills.  I am willing to do that, but good golly how much assistance does someone need?  Alarm isn't enough.  A knock isn't enough.  Wanting to not miss yet another practice isn't enough.  Now I need to make sure she comes out of her room.  I am certainly willing to do that, but at 16 I'm thinking I'm doing too much and she needs to take some responsibility for her schedule and actions.  She may be going to university in 10 months spending big bucks to go to school.  Does she think I will be responsible for getting her up in time then?   

\-Sorry this is so long.  I'm fairly overwhelmed because she just doesn't see the world the way her dad and I do.  (Her Dad and I are still married, been married a long time, we all live together, she's an only child).  She has an excuse for everything that goes wrong, and she blames a lot of her troubles on her dad and I. 

\-I know she really does not like us.  She is very upset with me that I even said I was upset that she over slept again.  Her text ""Do. Not. Say that to me"".  She is very difficult to talk to.

Is it unreasonable to think a 16 yo can get themselves out of bed without significant parent help?

Do other teenagers sleep through their iphone alarm ringing for 20-30 minutes?

Open to any help or suggestions you have to offer.  Thank you."
Parenting,child iphone,mou9vb,Wife sleeps in 10yo daughter's bed every night,"50 yo dad, 20 yrs married, one child here. My wife (M.) is the same age. Our daughter (S.) is 10 and - from a 20,000-foot view at least - is happy and well-adjusted; smart, social, and creative; reads voraciously; does well in school; has lots of friends.  We're very proud of her.

This past year, she has been spending way too much time (hours a day) playing games; it started with an intense interest in Minecraft (which I didn't mind so much as it was clearly a fairly rich creative outlet) but these days is more centered around Roblox and various freemium iPhone games, which I dislike because they don't seem to require much creativity or skill and I get the sense that a lot of them exist only to gull players into spending money to collect in-game items.   She also watches game-related YouTube channels.   We've been reluctant to restrict her game/screen time too much as due to the pandemic it is her main social outlet (she is lucky enough to attend school in-person but has no playdates, after-school activities, and the like, so she meets with friends online).  Judging from conversations with her friends' parents, this is a pretty universal concern today, and I'm hoping once the pandemic is over she'll broaden her spectrum of activities again.

She also can be very flippant and argumentative with M. (not so much with me). They have multiple contretemps daily, mostly around screen time, food, dress, and a few other subjects; I usually wake up to a loud argument about what S. can have for breakfast or what's appropriate for her to wear, or whether she is allowed to go online before school.  These aren't big, knock-down fights, more like loud squabbles, and usually end pretty quickly, but there are a lot of them, always on the same themes, and they do get on my nerves.

All in all, though, I don't see my daughter showing any major, pervasive behavioral problems.  I imagine arguments over screentime, dress, and food are pretty universal with preteens today.   I am concerned, though, about the fact that M. and S. have taken to sharing a bed in S.'s bedroom.  In the past, it was not uncommon for them to lie down together at S.'s bedtime to read, watch episodes of various series, or listen to audiobooks on M's laptop, and M. would often fall asleep there, but always wake up and come back to our bedroom in the middle of the night.  About a year ago, though, M. started spending the whole night, every night, in our daughter's bed; I sleep alone in the master bedroom.  This was never discussed, and M. never gave me a clear reason for it; it just suddenly became the norm. I have brought it up on multiple occasions and M. always brushes my questions aside; she simply refuses to acknowledge the situation -- often she'll just say ""mmmhmmm"" in lieu of answering me.  If I ask her point-blank why she is sleeping there, she says something vague about S. being afraid of the dark (she isn't, so far as I can tell, and was sleeping on her own for years before this); if I ask her to please at least come back to our bedroom once S. is asleep, she answers in a noncommittal way, then just continues sleeping there.  I've stopped bringing it up because to do so seems to be fruitless.

To be clear, because obviously this would be the primary concern: I do not think that there is anything abusive happening here. I don't see any signs at all of that. Nevertheless, I am (unsurprisingly) not happy with the arrangement, nor with M.'s unwillingness even to discuss it.  I'll put aside my own need for intimacy here; to be honest, that wasn't being fulfilled even when M. and i were sleeping in the same bed; we were intimate about once a year, and I had pretty much given it up for a lost cause a long time ago. I'm more concerned about potential effects on my daughter, but I'm not even sure if I should be worried or not.  I feel like I need a reality check here - with the pandemic, not seeing other families, it feels a bit like living in a hermetically-sealed unit, and I'm kind of losing a sense for what's normal and what's not.  Hence my post. 

Outwardly, as I said, S. is doing pretty well.  I have a sense, though, that her constant bickering and squabbling with M. is the other side of the coin from their sleeping together; to me, both things are signs that the whole mother-daughter relationship is a little unhealthy, almost too close, if that makes any sense. I feel like boundaries that should be present in the parent-child relationship (at age 10, at least) are missing.  A parent should be able to tell a child: ""sorry, no more playing with my phone"" and actually take it away if she doesn't put it down.  Instead, they will go on for a half-hour or more with M. constantly telling her to put the phone away and S. coming up with excuses not to   It's exhausting to listen to, and when I step in and just take the phone away, M. is upset that I'm being too harsh.  Similarly, I feel like ""this is what's for dinner tonight, eat it or go hungry"" is a reasonable parental stance (making allowances obviously for cases where a kid really doesn't like a particular food); S. knows that she can, with enough wheedling, usually get M. to give in and let her have something else.  On occasions that M. has been away (hasn't happened recently, of course) S. has always just eaten what I cooked for dinner, no questions asked. 

I also worry that we're setting a very poor example for S. about what a healthy husband-wife relationship is like.  When she grows up, if she gets married and has children is she going to end up sleeping in their bed, to her husband's (probable) dismay?  When I was a teen, I had a close friend who admitted to me that, growing up, he'd been horrified by the fact that his mother and father slept in separate rooms, to the extent that he was loath to have friends sleep over lest they find out this dark secret. I've never forgotten that (especially as my friend had a lot of emotional baggage to work through and ended up committing suicide as a young man).  And a husband and wife sleeping in different rooms doesn't even seem all that egregious to me (maybe one of them snored?), though I certainly would have found it odd back then. I have visions of my daughter talking to friends, or sleeping over once the pandemic is over, and suddenly realizing that it's not the norm for a mother to sleep with her 10-year-old every night. Not to mention, if she ever ends up mentioning it to anyone, they might indeed look askance.

Honestly, our family life is not too bad.  M. and I have a good marriage in most respects -- physical intimacy is, sadly, a distant memory, but other than that we are reasonably close; we discuss things, don't bicker all that much, and can come to agreement or compromise on major life decisions.  I'm not lying when I tell her I love her, and I believe she loves me too.  But at the same time, if someone had told me 20 years ago that my wife would end up sleeping in our 10-year-old daughter's bed every night, I would have thought it ridiculous, completely unacceptable.  Am I off-base here, or is this something I should just accept and not worry about?  If not, *what can I do to address it without making things worse?*

[Edit: to be clear, I am not soliciting advice about my relationship with M. *per se* - I know, I know, ""marriage counseling,"" the answer for every relationship question.   I'm asking about the *parenting* aspect of this.  Do I need to worry about the effect this will have on our daughter? If I can go to M. with some concrete evidence that this is not a good thing for our daughter, instead of just saying that I'm unhappy with the situation, I think she will be willing to change her behavior.]"
Parenting,child iphone,od402o,My child (12) told me I’m “flexing on them” the things they cannot/don’t have.,"So it’s a complicated story with my daughter. We got out of an abusive situation with her dad a while back, and I’m trying to get her to attend therapy. So far it hasn’t really worked. She refuses to do a virtual visit and acts like she won’t get in the car if I say let’s go. I do want her in therapy, but if she won’t talk or do anything there’s not much I can do. She ran away from her dad’s about six months ago when shit “hit the fan” and I found out he was treating her that way trying to go to someone she met on Discord. I got her back after that and obviously her access to that is now gone because she isn’t old enough to handle the responsibility of talking to strangers online (and I wouldn’t have thought so anyway, but she was with her dad at the time).

Today we were talking and it came up that I felt like I can’t trust her to stay alone again even for short periods because of what happened. She and I had talked before and she did say the situation with her dad and how bad he was is what caused her to run away. I asked her if she thought she was being treated better and if things were better and she said I was “almost as bad” as her dad, who was physically and emotionally abusive. I do not hit my child and I try not to even yell. I try to talk rationally to her. So I asked her what she thought was almost as bad. She didn’t want to tell me at first, but then said that I am “flexing on her” with the things I have that she doesn’t. For instance she has a flip phone for safety rather than a smart phone because of the Discord issue. It has approved friends she knows in real life and has met through school of her own age. She said that I am “flexing” having an iPhone, having nice makeup that I only buy on sale, and talking to and having friends. (I only have a few friends, for what it’s worth. I work from home and hardly go out.) I have bought her makeup and things for her hobbies but as an adult on a budget I take care of my items. I’ve had the same iPhone for years, I have an older gaming PC that has had one upgrade and my ps4. She has a switch, a Wii U, and is allowed to use my ps4. When she is bought makeup or figurines etc (she likes anime) she does not take care of them. She leaves her room a mess, steps on them, breaks them etc. and I can’t afford to just re-buy things over and over. I buy her the same kind of shirts I buy myself (hot topic and anime) but she stains them and again, doesn’t take care of them. I buy my pants at the thrift store to afford my shirts and hand wash them to keep the designs nice. I’ve offered to try to help her organize, to teach her to hand wash them etc.

The more I’m typing this out I don’t think I’m being unreasonable. I don’t allow her to have random Discord friends for her own safety because of her maturity level. I do buy her things or offer to let her earn them by helping extra around the house (which she won’t do). She has a chrome book for school but I’m not buying her a gaming PC when I can’t put parental controls on. I couldn’t even afford another right now anyway, money was better then.

TLDR: my daughter says I’m as bad as her abusive dad who is out of the picture because she doesn’t have friends as close or the same items I do. She breaks and doesn’t take care of her stuff so I don’t rebuy it without seeing a change in behavior. Am I in the wrong here? My parents weren’t into technology or anything I was so I never felt jealous or “flexed on” by what they had. Is this normal preteen angst? Anyone else experienced this?"
Parenting,child iphone,si12na,Ex and her husband got our son (9m) a cell phone - advice please.,"I’m not particularly against the idea, I know I’d love to be able to call him directly when he’s away at his moms, but the last time we tried the cell phone we had a major issue. I tried experimenting with letting our son have a cell phone while he was staying with me, it was an old IPhone which I was able to set up parental controls and monitor his behavior/activity. Things were going well and I felt like he could be responsible and use it on a regular basis, but I didn’t let him take the cell phone anywhere else besides the home. At the same time this was going on, his mom decided to also let him use an old IPhone she had, but she did not set up any parental controls whatsoever, she also only let him use it when he was with her. 

On this cell phone at his moms he created multiple social media accounts, TikTok, Snapchat, instagram where he amassed over 10k followers, unsupervised. When I found out I immediately checked the accounts, shut them down, and removed his cell phone privileges. I did this because of the huge potential risk of a young child being on the internet unsupervised. My ex agreed to this at the time and she stated she didn’t know about his activity. 

He’s now a year older and his mom and her husband decided to give him a cellphone for Christmas. My ex and I have not talked about cell phones since the last time he had one, and her and her husband made the decision without asking for any of my input. I voiced my concern, but also how I thought it was great they made the purchase (again, I know I’d love to be able to call him whenever), but I’m put off because I feel like this is a parenting decision to be made by my ex and I, and we should both be able to monitor and decide it’s proper use, especially after the last issue we had. 

My ex doesn’t seem to care, and she’s ignoring my request to talk about it before I allow it’s use while our son is with me. As of right now I just have to be okay with him having it, or be the bad guy and say he cannot use it. My ex has multiple alternatives to contact him, so he won’t be out of communication with her whatsoever. 

Am I in the wrong? Can I get some advice on figuring this out?"
Parenting,child iphone,rqq8xf,Securing Son's Iphone,"A few days ago I got a 3rd party app that was supposed to monitor my kids online habits with his new cell phone.  He had that thing uninstalled in about 5 minutes Which rendered it useless.

In subsequent discussions with other parents and reading other posts there is a way you can lock down a iPhone 12 that can limit a child's screen time as well as his or her ability to download and delete apps. Does anybody know anything about this?   Any online tutorials anybody can suggest?"
Parenting,child iphone,pqz0uv,iPhone for 8 Year Old Dilemma,"I never thought I would be this parent but  now I am considering getting her an iPhone as my daughter has rapidly increased her out of the house extra curricular activities, meeting a new friend that lives at the end of the street and having sleepovers and other friends houses. 

The reason it really made me think was I get off work at 4:00pm and pick my daughter up from school at 4:15. Well this past week I got stuck in traffic due to an accident  and all I wanted to do was tell her that I'm on my way so she doesn't worry. But when she got in the car I could tell she was a little upset because she was the last child to be picked up. 

She has an iPad already that is pretty heavily restricted as I have screen time limits set where she is not able to log in after certain hours or when she hits a daily maximum. So my question is...what is the difference between the iPad she has and an iPhone? 

The way you are able to restrict these iPhones these days it just seems like it makes more sense. Of course there is the jealousy aspect of me not having something like this as a child, but as technology gets better the world changes also. I have not purchased one yet and I am definitely still in the process of figuring out what to do and would love your input!"
Parenting,child iphone,r5gsxu,When is the right age?,"Step-mom here, more so inquiring on my husband’s behalf to get some insight because we aren’t on any media platforms except me and my reddit. 

50/50 custody and joint decision making of a 7 year old. 

Recently, his son’s mother had gotten him a brand new iphone 13 mini, and sends it in his backpack on my husband’s pick up days. They use a communication app, she sent him a message regarding the phone stating it’s for texting and facetime whenever child wants. He doesn’t even use it for the purpose it was allegedly bought for. 

Anyways, my husband has verbally expressed this dislike to me of his son having a full blown phone with like 700 apps including social media items like TikTok and Snapchat. However he has not expressed this to son’s mother, who bought it and demand he let him use it without previous discussions. 

My husband is having a hard time putting into words how to let her know he doesn’t agree to it; a 7 year old having a fully serviced cell phone, his own number and free reign of social media or devices in general, but doesn’t want to come off as restricting contact to mom, even though she will facetime me or call our house phone regularly to speak with child previously. Contact has never been a problem with mother and child. But she has a good habit of making things into arguments and he does whatever he can to avoid it which is another reason he hasn’t said anything to her regarding it. 

At soccer when his mother brings him, he’s face deep in it before games start while all his other teammates run around and kick a ball back and forth. he’s always playing games on it if we let him, he has zero want to do normal child things like play with toys, be outside etc. We’ve been trying to get him re-interested in things he used to love like skateboarding, drawing and coloring, jumping on the trampoline. he just wants to play on the phone constantly and will sit around doing nothing laying in bed/on the couch staring at a wall if he isn’t allowed the phone. 

So my question is, what is or isn’t appropriate or too much for a 7 year old? What is a healthy amount of device time? Do we just restrict usage of said phone while he’s here? How do we motivate kiddo to want to do more than play games on a phone all day? We try doing things and he just has zero interest in being engaged to real-life things. 

I’ll be honest and say we haven’t done much research regarding screen time, but it just seems like a bit much for a child in second grade to have. we’ve always had a limit set on devices here for two hours total in a day and a code is needed to exceed that timeframe, but no such timeframe exists on this new phone. 

My husband is really starting to get frustrated about son’s dependence of devices to stay occupied and wants to address it, but how she reacts about most things, he just doesn’t know how to address this with her without even more conflict then they already have. 

Any and all advice is welcome."
Parenting,child iphone,pzatc0,Is there an age limit on iPhone parental controls?,"I'm about to purchase an iPhone for my 13 year old, and I intend to totally lock it down with parental controls so that it only does phone, iMessage, email, calendar, Google Classroom, and camera. But before I invest in the phone, I want to make sure that full parental control restrictions are available for a thirteen year old's account. I've recently been informed by Microsoft and Google that my kid is gaining more control over their child account now that they've turned 13. Can anyone confirm that I'll be able to lock down the phone as planned? 

(PS - I'm not looking for suggestions to put a fake younger birthday on the child apple account; I just want to understand how parental controls work.)"
Parenting,child iphone,mwhewt,How much technology time are other teenagers getting?,"My almost 14 year old son, our oldest of 3 boys, is convinced that my wife and I are being unreasonably controlling about his computer and technology time. We have intentionally limited our kids use of television to only weekends, which includes switch and Xbox. They will get a movie during school nights every so often. 

He has an iPhone that turns on at 7:15 am and shuts off at 9:30 pm. Apple Screen Time is a joke of a software, but it does shut down apps at the time it’s supposed to. He also does not have safari or any browser on his phone. (Not that he can’t get to a browser otherwise, ie screen time sucks and you can open safari through gmail app). He also uses a laptop for homework, to voice chat on discord and will sometimes be allowed to play Minecraft after his homework is done. 

I feel like the limitations we’ve put on technology are reasonable for a 14 year old. But I would love to hear how other parents have limited their teenagers use of tech and what they think of our process.

Update:

Thank you to those who provided constructive help for us. We needed to hear how others are handling this issue. We are parents who are working hard on creative ways to help our children grow up in this new environment of the digital age. Many of you have head great empathy for us and I Iearned some things. 

For those who insist on the gatekeeping and use parent shaming. Please think about your approach to helping other parents who are asking for help. Many of you shamed me because you believe that we are ludites and acting like we are locking our children in their bedroom whenever they have free time. 

1. Parenting is not an exact science. Please don’t talk in definitives. 

2. Parenting is hard. Please speak encouraging words not shaming words. 

3. Parenting is the responsibility of those who are the caretakers of those kids. Every child is different. Just because you’ve seen something that works or doesn’t work for one child, doesn’t mean that result will be the same for another."
Parenting,child iphone,nlp5n4,Child’s father lack of interest,"The father of my two kids (ages 6 and 7) never calls to talk to them or is involved in their day to day lives in any way. The last time they spoke to him was in April. The trend has been one call a month, if that. 

They have their own iPad and iPhone and my ex does not need to go through me to talk to them. 

I have full custody and he has visitation rights and pays child support weekly. His mom took them for a long weekend for Easter but he didn’t see them because he had a new baby and was in the hospital. The last time he saw them was Christmas time for 2 weeks. Court papers state he is allowed 1 weekend a month - 2 weeks for summer and 2 weeks for Christmas he just doesn’t utilize it. 

I am just worried about how his lack of interest will effect/ is effecting their mental health. They view my husband as a father - I am just at a loss here. Any advice would be great."
Parenting,child iphone,j870qy,"Dangers of snapchat, mspy is HORRIBLE (read inside), any suggestions on monitoring","Sorry for the three topics in one subject heading, but Im frustrated and needed a place to chat and vent.  

Like many households, my wife and I made the decision to allow our children to have smart phones.  Again like many households, it started innocently enough with our first child in middle school with lots of oversight, rules and monitoring.  However, as time moved on and the perception of responsibility and maturity took over, we paid less and less attention to our oldest as our younger 2 boys required more time.

Enter snapchat.  We really had no clue just how devious this app was.  I understood the basics behind it.  Chat, send pics and vids, and everything is deleted.   I wasnt super worried about the social aspects of this for my kid as he is smart, does good in school, has lots of extracurriculars, and all in all is pretty well rounded.  To be honest, I was no angel at 16 and I do realize that kids grow up...16 years old and this is how the teenagers communicate, whats the worse that can happen...Boobs and d1ck pics?    My wife and I have always tried to be open, honest, and informative when it comes to discussing sexual relationships but in the end it is up to them to make and be accountable for their decisions.  All that being said...there was 1 thing I overlooked....the DRUGS!!!  

I had no idea...and not to spoil the ending here...but I think we caught this in time.   Anyway....if you arent aware, here is how it works.....There are literally drug dealers on snapchat...and lots of them.  One small aspect of snap chat are snap maps.  it makes it real easy to see where any of your friends are.  you simply go to the map and it shows you were everyone is.  Another aspect is your snap chat story...its just like facebook or instagram feed where you just post stuff and everyone that you want to see it will see it.   

Taking these things into consideration, these guys/girls constantly update their stories with a mixture of cars, bling, cash, guns, girls and then all the drugs that they currently have with them and how much it all costs.  as a kid, all you have to do is snap a dealer ""soccer practice ends in 10 mins, this is where I am, my moms gonna be 20 mins late, Ill take zannies, lean, cookies and cream and some shatter"" its that easy and your kid just bought xanax, codeine, marijuana and another form of smokable THC.  They can get vape, dabs, pills, pot, guns, whatever anyone is selling.  Doesnt matter where you live, how nice it is or how many gates there are.  There are people in your community selling drugs and they can and will get to your kids on snapchat.  Any moment your child is not within your sites, they can be buying drugs...its that easy.  You can go 500 miles away on vacation and your child can link up with a drug dealer before the plane lands or you park the car.  Thats just the reality of whats going on

&#x200B;

Im my kids case, on his phone he was following like 15 of these guys.  Did he buy and use...yup!  Did I catch him..yup!  Is he now drug tested minimum once a week...yup!  I digress a bit from this to bring up mspy

&#x200B;

i tried mspy for like 2 hours and realized it ain't the answer.  there is nothing out there that can monitor snapchat...i mean nothing.   even rooting an iPhone and adding mspy doesn't work...or work well....and on a side note, mspy...once they get your money, good luck getting a refund, they will do anything other than give you your money back.  As I said, I bought it, tried it for less than 24 hours and then realized it wasn't the answer.

&#x200B;

Im going to end this WOT with a request for any diligent parents to post their monitoring solutions.  Also, I appreciate all comments but if you're gonna tell me to not allow snapchat, dont bother...its the only way the kids are communicating unfortunately.  removing it puts them on a socially void island....believe me, I watched it for 2 months while he was grounded from his phone and its hard to witness them being cut out of their social group"
Parenting,child iphone,l8wh66,I have no clue how to play with my 16 month old,"She has every toy, tunnel, ball pit, little ride-on car, blocks, a whole bunch of Leap Frog toys, crayons/markers, plenty of toys she can handle and manipulate. She plays with them a little bit, but mostly, she loves to just run around, climb the stairs over and over, play in our shower, handle any kind of iPhone wire/charger (which is always a pleasure getting away from her), and basically play with anything not meant to be a child’s toy. She also loves going outside, but it’s been very cold where I am (not to mention the snow we’re about to get hit with), so taking her out hasn’t been easy (one day last week, I was able to take her to the park where we’d spend 5-10 minutes playing, then 10 minutes in the car - did that for about 40 minutes, which she enjoyed). I’ve tried to set up obstacle courses multiple times, and, yet again, she’s into it for a minute or two before moving on to the next thing. I’m home until later this year and my wife works from home. I spend about 90% of every day with my daughter and I don’t know if I’m just too exhausted to think straight, but her not playing with toys very much and only staying put if she’s watching something on Disney+ or sitting on my wife’s lap in front of her computer makes me concerned she isn’t getting enough quality play time as so much of what she does is just bounce all over, showing varying degrees of interest in “official” toys or random things around the house (she loves to go through our spice cabinet, for example).

Any help, feedback, or advice on what I could be doing better, I’d appreciate it. Thanks, fellow parents."
Parenting,child iphone,lpho4a,Coparenting confliction...,"Me (4yrs old)DDs father(33y) and I(24y) split 2 years ago. The relationship was never great. Coparenting while “together” was hard enough. But since the split it’s been impossible. He’s around on HIS accord. He’ll come around, request visits (I NEVER deny-unless unreasonable) he will buy flashy, expensive stuff, like an iPhone 11pro... for our 4 year old, amongst many other unnecessary items, to which I never refuse her, because he got them for her. I’m not resentful about the money he spends. We make well money ourselves. What bothers me is that he will come around for two weeks, decide he doesn’t like something, or wants to pick and fight with my fiancé because he’s with me and BD isn’t, and block my daughter and ignore her for months on end. While I beg and plead for him to see her and he makes it my fault for being with someone else, that he won’t be seeing her. I’ve finally drawn a line. No more. He refused to sign her BC and I’ve never pushed for any legal actions. No child support, etc. nothing. Ever. So I decided to drop all contact. No more begging. No more asking. Now that I’ve cut all ties and am trying to let my daughters broken heart mend, he’s calling all of my family asking for visits, but refuses to set a schedule or come to ANY written agreement with my fiancé and I regarding these visits. My step dad is telling me I’m wrong for cutting contact and refusing visits without an agreement in place and believes I should allow him to be the middle man (we’ve done this it didn’t work in the end) and “just see how it goes”. But that’s the thing. I can’t keep seeing how it goes. My child’s heart literally aches every time he comes in and disappears. It’s not fair. Isn’t it my responsibility to shield her from that? Or should I be willing to let her be hurt by him and hope she’ll understand in the end he’s the issue? I’m at a loss. I want nothing more than for her to have that relationship with him.

Parenting,child iphone,ga3o1w,I just learned how to disable the touch screen on my iPhone while my toddler plays with it,"I learned this today and wanted to share! This is amazing if you have a toddler or small child and you don’t want to then to exit the video you play for them or the game they are playing or whatever. I have an iPhone so I only know how to do it on that but you go to your settings and tap on General. Then accessibility, then scroll all the way down to guided access. Turn it on. Then turn the accessibility shortcut on. (it should be on the same screen) Then, click on passcode settings. Click on set guided access passcode. I made mine my kids birthday since that’s the only time I use this feature. And that’s it! Go to the app you want your child on, Triple click your home button (newer iPhones triple click the lock button)  and it will activate. It will allow you access within the app you are using. To disable the entire screen circle the entire screen on the options and boom you’re all set. To exit triple click home button again and enter the password you set up. This is an amazing hack, hope it helps!"
Parenting,child iphone,57jor3,"I took my toddler to a hotel, am I overacting?","Hi all, throw away, I need some moral support and insight from fellow parents. Warning, this will be long. 

I just checked into a hotel with my toddler after a fight I had with my husband. He texted me from the sprint store asking me for my security pin so he could upgrade his phone to an iPhone 7. The problem is, we had agreed that we were going to let our contracts run out so we could switch and we only have 8 months left. We had discussed him upgrading before because he just *has* to have something once he gets it in his head and I had said I thought it was a bad idea because I was unemployed and we couldn't afford to buy out his contract in 8 months when I switched. I refused to give him the pin so he immediately called me and started saying things like ""what is your problem, now the guy moved on to the next person in line."" So I was immediately on the defensive and started laying into him about how he needs to discuss major financial decisions with me prior to being with the sales person in the store. He started responding ""whatever you say MOM, sure thing MOM."" At that point I lost it and started screaming that it's part of being a couple to make these kinds of decisions together. It's not me trying to dictate to him, it's me being pissed off because he's not showing me proper respect as his wife. Our therapist recently talked to us about parent/child dynamics so he's been throwing that in my face a lot lately. 

So at this point let me give you some back story. My husband smoked weed before I got pregnant but we agreed he would quit before I got pregnant. When my son was two years old I started noticing things like blood shot eyes and suspicious activity. I'd ask him if he was smoking and he'd say no. Finally, after months of this back and forth I caught him in the act of smoking. We were on a family vacation and he had parked while we went to the room. Unbeknownst to him our new hotel room was above where he parked the car. So my toddler and I stood at the window to wave to him. He didn't see us but I saw him look left and right like a cartoon villain and sneak a puff of weed. Then he saw me staring at him. We had a fight but I told him I was more angry about the lying than the weed smoking and agreed to wait for him to tackle cigarettes before he attempted to quit weed again. We did agree the paraphernalia would be hidden at all times and he wouldn't smoke till after bedtime. 

For the record I'm only against weed because it's illegal in our state. But I still think it should be treated like alcohol (like don't get drunk around your kid). 

Well last week my car broke down and he and my now three year old came to pick me up. The car reeked of weed and when I asked him about it he admitted he had just come from his dealers house and had weed in the car with our son. He had also taken our son when he bought the weed. I was livid and told him what would he do if he had been pulled over? Our son would be taken away by CYFD in a flash. He seemed remorseful but I was still upset and have been waiting for our next couples counseling session to discuss it. 

Anyway, last night I had also gotten extremely upset with him over weed. For weeks I've been smelling weed in the house and have asked him if he brought his weed inside. He says ""no, I just might smell that way because I just smoked."" Well last night I smelled a sudden whiff while reading my son a bedtime story and dropped everything and stormed into his office next door to find him smoking. I started yelling at him that he has been lying to me and breaking the rules we both agreed upon etc... We left that fight unresolved because he's on call and a server crashed and he had to work (from home). He worked till about 3am so we didn't get to discuss it. 

So back to today's fight. All of this just started spewing out of me. How he's a liar and I can't trust anything he says. He doesn't think about our son or put his safety first. And I needed him to just not come home tonight while I figured out how I was feeling. He told me I was over exaggerating and playing the victim and that I was just being overly dramatic. He said he was coming to the house that he paid *rent* for no matter what I say (we own our home but I owned it before we got married so I'm the only one on the deed. We live in a joint property state though, so no matter what is on the paperwork he owns half). I said fine as long as he didn't speak to me, I didn't want to hear him trying to further invalidate my feelings. 

So of course when he gets home he starts trying to pick a fight. Complaining that the house isn't clean, asking whose money did I spend to buy a new book for my son. I asked him to please stop verbally harassing me to which he responded ""if you don't want to be around me go to a hotel."" My son got very excited at this prospect so I decided to pack the two of us a bag. That's where we are now. 

It's always been a priority for both of us that our son grows up with both parents. We also both believe that marriage shouldn't be treated lightly and it shouldn't be given up on. Plus, there are still things I love and admire about him. Despite his horrible money management skills and the lying, my husband is a decent dad and husband. He splits the load 50/50 and is really patient with our son. He is also willing to work on our relationship through therapy. Also, he supports me financially. I was laid off in March and my unemployment has recently run out. He has reluctantly supported me while I try to become a freelance web designer/graphic designer. That has been going decently, I've been earning about $500 a week. But that's not enough to support myself without his income. He makes just under six figures. 

So I'm not sure what I should do. Or if I can even do it. Reddit, any advice would be greatly appreciated. "
Parenting,child iphone,inm48v,Smashed my kids’ phone,"I have 3 kids age 3 and up and a 6 month old. The toddler and her older brothers (my step-sons) all share an old iPhone I used to use. It creates problems however as my youngest boy(6) and my toddler(3) are both on the spectrum and fight for control over having the phone, and my oldest(8) will hog the phone all day and not properly share it. We’ve had to take the phone away for weeks at a time and the issues still persist once given back. Well a couple of days ago while my boys were at their real dad’s house, my toddler was being very disruptive and irritable with the phone during bedtime and in a fit of rage (and more-so being fed up with the fact at she and her brothers may have a severe addiction to it) I smashed the phone over my knee right in front of her. Normally I do not snap at any of my kids this hard and something just came over me and made me feel like I had to eliminate the problem as a whole. She immediately lost it and I could tell I somewhat betrayed her trust in me. I know doing it in front of her wasn’t right, but just taking it away caused more issues than not. I feel absolutely horrible and guilty over it, but at the same time her overall behavior has improved quite a bit in these following days. Again I’m not saying I was right for doing it, but was removing it completely the right thing to do? I also feel bad for my boys because they had games and progress in those games that is now lost and they still aren’t back from their dad’s house yet so they have no idea. Also, my wife believes my toddler destroyed it, as any time she gets angry when the phone dies she throws it to the ground as hard as possible (which I believe is the reason it broke so easy in the first place). Again, I feel absolutely horrible for taking away a huge source of entertainment and destroying months of work and progress on my boys’ games, but at the same time we pay for all these streaming services for them to use and they’d rather not use them. My daughter apologized to me for me smashing the phone which also makes me feel horrible but at the same time, the house as a whole (so far) seems to be improving. We will be replacing the phone for my toddler with a child-branded tablet and will be getting the boys Nintendo Switch Lites for Christmas, but I still feel like I did something I shouldn’t have. I feel horrible but I believe it was for the greater good of my home, and it will be replaced with their own individual devices come December. Please give any insights as to your opinions on the matter. Was I really as wrong as I feel? Or did I take the right steps (albeit in the wrong way, I can admit to that) in fixing the constant fighting and bickering in my house between the three of them?"
Parenting,child iphone,ivmwq4,What phone was your kid's first? What do they have now?,"My daughter, 12 years old and in 7th grade, has been asking for a phone ever since Covid struck, I'm assuming since she's super bored. I don't really have any objections to it, I do feel that since this year she will be walking to the city library near her school and most likely will go to the shopping center near her school with her friends, then she would most likely need a phone to have a way to contact me if something goes wrong and get into contact via social media and messaging apps with her friends. I especially think it's time that she needs to be able to communicate with her friends outside of school hours, specifically right now since we have no idea how much longer her school will be shut down for. I'm the only one at home with her so she's bored most of the time and ends up using her laptop for a large duration of the day when she's not in school. She's my only child and her dad works in Europe and is rarely here. She has been an extremely good kid, and I have no trust issues with her doing inappropriate/illegal things on the phone.

&#x200B;

My question is what type of phone did you give your kids as their first? How did they do with this phone? Have you had any problems/issues with it (with the kid or the phone itself)? What phone (if different than their first) do your kids have now? I would like to know this information so I can decide what type of phone to get my daughter. I'm currently considering the iPhone XR for her and I think she'll like it, but I'd like to know what your opinions are. If you have any suggestions for a phone feel free to send it too."
Parenting,child iphone,gw7bp2,How to teach children to be less entitled?,"Hello, I am the guardian to my young and only sister, Emma\*. She is 14, I am in my early 20s.

Our parents were immigrants from southeast Asia, and while raising me (an unplanned child) did not have a lot of resources at their disposal. Later, our standard of living improved drastically. As a result, my sister and I have had very different upbringings: I got my first phone at age 19, she got hers at age 10; my clothes were hand-downs, hers are from the mall; I was often left alone, she had a nanny, and vice versa.

I don't envy her. Currently, my sister is coping with a lot of loss, depression and anxiety. She has medication, therapy, and lots of love from our extended relatives. It has helped a lot, and she has grown so much in the last two years.

That being said, Emma is very entitled--I think as a result of being raised with our parents in such an abundant environment. She says things like, ""All of my friends have iPhone 11's"" or demands that I buy this or that for her. This makes me angry because

A.) I need to save money for more important things

B.) I don't understand the impulse to always own the newest thing

C.) She seems to have no concept for the value of money.

I have tried reasoning with Emma--that I can't afford it, that it's not necessary, etc., but she seems to shut down every time, without listening. We have a good relationship but I am really struggling. How do I help my 14-year-old learn perspective and reduce her sense of entitlement?"

I’m a 22 year old single women with a older daughter (9) she will be 10 soon moved out of my parents house into one I bought for my child and I at 17 Its a two bedroom standalone house and my sister is 27 and married with two kids a girl (8)and a boy (3) and my sisters son has stabbed my nine year old with a fork and when I confronted my older sister about her son stabbing my daughter. And she said that it’s my daughter’s fault that she shouldn’t have been playing with her iPad that I bought my own child with my own money ( I have a okay paying job and I bought a two bedroom one bath house for my child and I) and then she said boys will be boys also she said “iPads are bad for children”  I’m quoting her and was bashing me about buying my daughter one (I get my daughter a new iPad every two years or so and she owned a iPad since she was 18 months, I bought her a new one for Christmas 2020 because she needed more space on it for school and her games)then she took my daughters iPad from her and gave it to her son, the one that stabbed my daughter just minutes before, my daughter called me ( I bought my daughter a flip phone, yes a flip phone, I prefer if she didn’t have a iPhone and it’s only for emergency uses so like 911 or me or my parents and her friends and their parents saved on there) and was crying when she told me what happened and that she was bleeding I dropped everything I was doing ( I was at a meeting and when I told my bosses my daughter Is hurt they understood)and I went straight to her and when I got to my older sisters house because I left my daughter there so I can attend a meeting in the town she lives in I took my daughters iPad away from her son and told my daughter to go grab her bag and get ready to leave my sister she blew up and said that I had no right to take away that iPad and called my mom about it like the child she is.And I got in trouble because she’s “always” right I sent my dad pictures of my daughters wound and I guess my dad spoke to my mom and my mom apologize to me and my daughter and my parents tried to get my sister to discipline her son, didn’t work she wouldn’t do it she won’t even talk to him about bad behaviour. I haven’t took my daughter over there since the incident. My sister and her two kids came to visit our parents I didn’t know that my sister and her son were there I only knew about my niece My mom came to pick up my daughter to go visit what I thought it was only just my niece there and I sent my daughters new iPad and her old iPad, I didn’t know my sister and her son my nephew were there at my parents house (mind you the three year old boy is the size of a six/seven year old child) my daughter called me crying telling me that her auntie took away both her iPads and gave both of them to her son because he was hitting my daughter and niece for them (I sent one iPad for my daughter to use and one for my niece to borrow for the days she was visiting) and my sister threw a fit when I got there to go get my daughter and her iPads her son threw my daughters two iPads on the floor breaking the new one I had bought for my daughter to use for school and I spent over 1000$ on it ps it was in a case he just took it off and my daughter knows to not take off the case because she knows the value of her items even though she’s nine, she’s also in grade seven she skipped a few grades her son took off the case on my daughters new iPad when I yelled at my sister that she should teach her son some manners and that she has to get my daughter a screen replacement and I work hard to make sure my daughter has the best things she said I’m not spending my money on your bratty daughter (both her and her husband have good jobs and can afford it) and I think I should mention that we’re a family of only girls no boys the only male we grew up with was our dad and her son is the only male that was born into our family. 
Sorry it was long but honestly what should I do about the situation should I forgive her or should I just avoid her for a while we live in different towns and I live in the same town as my parents so I see them often and my dad works in the same school as my daughter goes to and Me and my daughter go on vacation during the holidays so we don’t even see our family on holidays so it would be easy to avoid her. And if you have any ideas on what should I do please reply. 

My mom paid for the screen replacement because she said she should of told me and she would of taken away the iPads from my nephew before things got heavy like that so she technically took the blame. But I think my sister should teach her son that hitting/hurting girls is bad and that he shouldn’t do that."

Anyway I’ve tried every parenting trick in the book and nothing holds his attention long enough to make things easier. Changing his diaper is like entering a war zone and the only thing that seems to keep the peace and poop where it needs to be is by giving my son my phone to chew on/ look at or having my husband keep his upper body occupied while I do the dirty work.

Parenting,child iphone,4wm5vk,At 12:30am last night a parent rang my doorbell because my 12 texted her son that she took a bunch of pills.,"Hello fellow parents....

Like the title says, but with a bit more explanation, last night my doorbell rang at 12:30am and standing at the door was a very genuinely concerned Mother that was trying to explain to me through my sleep fog that my 12 year old daughter texted her son that she took a bunch of pills and was ""going to sleep now"".

So here is some background:  my 12 year old daughter has the looks and body of an 18 year old, and is going through raging hormones and is extremely sexual (not active but very aware of her beauty and changes in her body). Previous to last night, other incidents included discovery of porn and dick pics on her phone. I flat out blocked that and all apps I couldn't audit (eg Snapchat. I removed everything but Messages and the camera app from her iPhone and all messages started coming to me. That was in April.  After this happened (literally 3 days later) I received a call from the Jr high principal that she was caught cheating on a test.  For this, I made an appt with the teacher and had 12 y/o write a letter of apology as to why what she did was wrong and why it wouldn't happen again. 

During this time I actively was seeking a qualified therapist for counseling, but the first available appt was 6 weeks out.

In May I was awoken at 12:36am by her little dog barking crazily, and I discovered her missing. Her window screen was popped out and her phone was playing music loudly on her bed, but she was nowhere to be found. I absolutely panicked. I called police, had my husband and son looking for her, called her father and his wife, woke up neighbors. I'm not sure what the definition of a panic attack is, but that night was mine. While sitting at the table with the police giving them a description of her clothing, pictures and her ssn so she could be put in the national database, she climbed back in through her window.

At that point I was so incredibly upset and angry with her. After police left, her  Dad and I and our respective spouses sat down with her and she basically thumbed her nose at us, said was she did was 'no big deal' and walked away from us. Because of my level of anger I sent her home with her Dad where she stayed for 1 month. Things in my home were substantially better, but then dad travels 80% and I have primary residence, so back home in early July. 

During this time she is diagnosed ODD (no co-morbid factors). We're working hard on trust and maturity and responsibility, right? She has earned some privileges back like Instagram and Snapchat. I have access to her phone, which I took on Friday and counseled her to be appropriate with friends, don't start or get involved with drama, and sexual innuendo.

So last night....this Mom's eyes were as big as silver dollars. She really thought 12 y/o was in danger. My initial response after seeing my laughing 12 y/o saying it was just a joke was to paddle her butt, but that mom was scared. I reassured her and sent her home. 

This morning, I confiscated 12 y/o's phone and was discussing the incident with her. Ensuring she doesn't have suicidal thoughts (she says she doesn't and laughed about it). I reiterated the seriousness of the situation, her lapse of judgement and lack of maturity. Her only response ""when do I get my phone"". 

I am beyond disappointed, sad and bullied by this child. I'm smart, confident, I 'know' what to do. I have resources, insurance, support, parental time off (about maxed). Each day with her I dread, I swear. And not just me, but my husband and her brother. 

What do I do at this point. 

Edit: Thank you to each and everyone of you that responded. You have enlightened and encouraged me for next steps. Here is the plan: 1. No more smart phone 2. Arrange family counseling, and continue with individual counseling 3. Parent with love and empathy, own my actions and reactions 4. Keep her busy busy busy 5. Listen and love. I've got this Reddit! "

Parenting,child iphone,3cdz7j,11 Year Old Daughter - spoiled? bratty? my fault?,"I have an 11 year old daughter.  She is extremely bright.  She is also very sensitive and always has been.

She has a terrible attitude problem.  I know that I have caused this by being too lenient or inconsistent with rules.  My deep-seated fear is that I will be a mean mom (I had an extremely cruel mother), but I have known for a few years that I went too far in the other direction, and have remedied a lot of my lenience and inconsistency.

The thing is, my daughter isn't out of control.  She gets along great with other kids, gets As in school, reads at a high school level, I never hear of anything going awry from the school or other parents.

The issues are subtle, and they only happen with me.  Here is an example and why I am wracking my brain right now:

I had plans to meet a good friend after work tonight for a little shopping and dinner.  My husband wanted to come, so I told my daughter about it and she said she wanted to come too.  We all went and we had a great time shopping at a used book store and at a record store.  She and I were laughing and having fun together, just a blast.

Then we had to decide on where to get dinner.  The first place we were all happy with was booked solid so we decided to go to another place.  My friend said ""they might not have a lot of vegetarian there since it's southern food.""  She then rolled her eyes and said, ""I don't want to go there.""  I mean, unless it's a vegetarian restaurant, there will likely only be one or two things other than a salad that she can eat there, we run into this every time we eat out.  Similar problem would have happened at restaurant number 1.

Since three out of four of us decided on this place, and I knew she'd have the same trouble anywhere, we went there.  My friend was asking her, ""Are you ok with this?""  She didn't even respond to him.  In my eyes, she is 11.  She is outnumbered.  I will do what I can to accommodate her everywhere we go.  She will never go hungry!

So while walking down to the place, she starts walking ahead of me angry as all hell.  This is typical behavior for her when she a) doesn't get what she wants or b) is just plain done hearing me try to have conversation with her.

I told her, ""If you are going to have an attitude, we can just leave.""

Her: no response.

Me, ""Ok, let's just go.""

Her: ""No I'm fine.""

**And I could tell she was wrestling with herself and trying to not be so pissed.**

We get to the place and she sits in silence.

We look over the menu and all make decisions.

I asked her what she is getting.

Her: silence.

The waiter comes over and she orders shrimp and grits.  This was all on her own, she didn't ask me what any of the ingredients were, and didn't look anything up on her iphone (we live in a major metro city, every kid here has an iphone, she was one of the last to get one at 9).  One of the ingredients was andouille which if you are not familiar, is sausage a HUGE no-no for her strict vegetarian/pescatarian diet.

My husband read the menu as she ordered and asked the waiter if it could be made without the andouille and he said, ""it's in the sauce.""

My daughter just starts crying to herself and turns around.

The waiter then offers, ""we can make the dish without the sauce.""

I say, ""Can we just have a minute here?""

My husband says, ""oh they can make it without the sauce? is that ok?""

Daughter: nods yes

Then the waiter leaves and it's insanely awkward and my daughter is sitting there looking away and just stewing and upset.  I don't know what to do.  She doesn't say a word.

I said, ""you know what? let's just go.""  I felt like it wasn't going to be salvaged, and because of how I've been trying to implement discipline lately, I am just utterly done at this point.

I left and my daughter came with me.  I wasn't going to sit across from her and watch her pick at a $17 entree, stewing and pissed off in silence.  I'm not going to be able to talk to my husband or our friend if she is sitting in the corner glaring at her phone because her food originally came with andouille and we have had to ask for it to be changed and she didn't want to go there in the first place.

I have no perspective on this.  When I was a kid, I had no say in anything.  If my parents took me to mcdonald's I was grateful beyond words.  I would thank them for hours.  I was so grateful for every tiny little thing.  I only got necessities (shoes, face wash, clothes for school) strictly as gifts twice a year at christmas and my birthday, I didn't have a say in anything and didn't have a voice.  If you are interested in my family dynamic, my parents are narcissists and I was the scapegoated child.  I am in reddit raisedbynarcissists under a difference username.

My thoughts are...we chose the restaurant and YOU are a guest, but this is about us right now.  We do things just for her all the time.  But this one dinner was about the adults and she was invited along and we always include her.  I feel like she has got to learn that if you have diet restrictions, especially by choice, then you are going to have to be outnumbered most of the time by meat eaters, and yes you may even be forced to eat the dreaded salad every now and then.

I just feel like since I didn't cater to her, she was absolutely miserable and she completely folded when the andouille thing was brought to her attention.

What the hell have I done to create this mess?  I feel like punishing this behavior is a) necessary but b) isn't it me who needs punishing for setting this up? I set her up to fail by catering to her.  Is it too late?? How militant do I need to be?

So, on our walk home, I said, ""If you and your friend were out having ice cream and I sat across from you and pouted, would you have fun with your friend?""  She said, ""no"". I said then you can see why that behavior is unacceptable.  This was as she was walking ahead of me.  Then I said, ""When you are ready to tell me why this is unacceptable, you can have your phone and computer back, but you can't have them tonight.""  She just said, ""Fine.""  Then when we got home, she took a shower, and I made her a plate of fresh veggies and hummus and some applesauce since we missed dinner.

Is this too harsh of a punishment?  Is it right to punish her even though I have set her up to fail?  I know I have serious issues here, but please, I have been in therapy for three years, I am working extremely hard on myself, and also I have made leaps and bounds in adjusting my parenting. It's just the attitude problem with her, and her basically ruining any outing when she doesn't get exactly what she wants (sometimes she doesn't even know what she wants, she JUST knows that she DOESN'T want what I want).

I'd like to hear advice or stories from parents of children around her age.  I do NOT want to do her the disservice of spoiling her - I am truly just baffled by how much I should cater to her wants.  Her needs are well taken care of, but what about what she wants?  Obviously nothing and everything are off the table here.  What is a good balance?  How can I avoid this happening again??  Should I have just left when the attitude starting peaking out?  The threat of leaving wasn't enough for her.

One thing we have done is implemented a VERTY strict money policy.  If she wants to buy anything, even a small book or shirt, she has to pay for it out of allowance money.  She gets $10 a week if her chores are done perfectly, and if they aren't, she gets $8 or $5 or $1 depending on how well they are done.  This is the only spending money she has for ice cream, going skating, or doing anything fun with her friends.  This is a new concept here, I used to just hand her money, but my therapist and I came up with the allowance - and it is working extremely well.  She does her chores now.  When I was a kid, my parents didn't drive me anywhere or give me money for anything ever, so I had no concept of what is the right way to handle money with kids.  Sorry if I sound clueless or naive, I am working my ass off in therapy to be the best mom possible and really trying to change gears here with rules/appropriate boundaries/strictness and most of all consistency.

Thanks for reading, sorry it's so long, and please be nice, I am here to get advice.  I am also talking to my therapist about this incident tomorrow to help me shed light onto this problem.  I know my daughter has a good head on her shoulders.  I just can't imagine her having a job at 16 or 17 and respecting any authority.  This has to change NOW so she can function later.  Thanks for reading."
Parenting,child iphone,5he0kr,My husband 15yr old son is making me choose between him and my husband.,"My ex husband and I split up when my son was 1. I started dating a man pretty much right away. His dad met someone at the same time and they are also still together. We dated, moved in together and got married. I was pretty cautious about introducing my son, I've watched my sister introduce countless men to her kids so I avoided that. We took it slow. I handled all the parenting, my husband has provided us a good home and everything we need. My ex husband is difficult. Harassed me for a long time because I left him. He was/is a deadbeat. When we were together he was going to school full time and working. When I was 7 months pregnant he decided a career in an office wasn't for him and took a $6.50/hr pt job at a golf course and never went back to full time employment. That behavior didn't work for me. He emptied our bank accounts,  sold drugs but used them all, etc. 




Over the years my ex husband would do just about anything to ruin my relationship with my son. Would lie to him and say he paid a ton of money to me in child support and I just live a lavish life off of it. His dad lied about what he made, never paid support on time and the max he was ever ordered to pay was $300/MO. I didn't even ask for support utility my son was 9 and his dad was starting to demand that I provide clothes for both of our homes, he didn't want to buy anything EVER. If I wasn't the worst person on earth before then, I was after asking for support. Everything became my fault. His dad got arrested for no tags on his car... it's my fault because I take all his money for support. He actually argued at the support hearing that my husband makes enough to support us so it's not right he should pay me. 




My ex husband also has an issue holding my son accountable for anything. If I make a rule, he will tell my son not to follow it. He would buy him things like iphones and then tell me I have no right to withold it from my son as a punishment. He would tell my son to hide electronics from me. Meanwhile he was failing his classes, I'd catch him up at all hours of the night on devices and he would sleep through class. When my son failed, it would never be his fault. It's MY fault because I have more children now and my attention is divided so I'm a bad mom. He went so far as to tell my son this many times. That I am the reason why he is failing. That I am a bitch. That's their pet name for me, psycho bitch. That was charming to see in text. My ex encouraged my son to steal from me many times. To take my electronics and not get caught. I have screenshots of text messages where my ex encouraged my son to steal all of his and my other children's savings bonds for college and take them to his house. Things were spirling out of control. My son failed every class starting in 6th grade. 7th I got him extra help which his dad fought. I tried to get him therapy, his dad fought. I got him on adhd medication, his dad would not return it, not give to him, refused to believe was a real thing, all of it. I home schooled my son to repeat 7th at home when the school would not hold him back (had an iep for adhd, they just wanted to pass him through to highschool). That made me a bad mom too. Homeschooling is so bad acording to him.  All of his problems were because I'm isolating him. I am a very, very active parent. We have museum memberships, frequent botanical gardens, see historical sites, vacation every year, camp, hunt, fish, etc. The only thing I don't do is drink and party. His dad would tell me what a loser I am for having no friends. Meanwhile he's okay letting drunk strangers sleep off a night of partying in my kids bedroom, or just everyone's kids all sleep over together, mixed ages, no supervision. 




I'm getting off track but I'm trying to explain what is going on. Things got way out of control in the past two years. My son lives his life online, is a pathological liar, catfishes people, claims to be sick online, claims to be his own father, had stolen credit card numbers and was buying on amazon. I marched him into the police station and had him arrested. At 13. 38 felony counts of theft by deception and access device fraud. Worked with the DA to get required supervised Internet access at his dad's house, therapy, community service, etc. Honestly it was a blessing. I needed someone on my side and I needed someone else to hold him accountable. 




He continued to fail classes. He hasn't gotten anything better than an f in years. He doesn't participate in class at all. Brings home an empty bookbag. He's destructive at home. To his very small siblings (would punch them in the face, in the stomach, one of my kids has a feeding tube and is disabled and is a girl.. 8 years younger and she was still getting hit by him). He lit fires, he sprayed soap on the floors of the house, knocked holes in the walls, slashed our car seats with a box cutter, threw knives into the floor and took pictures of all of this shit and put it online. I found out he had a Facebook account even though we mutually agreed he could not have one. His dad actually just set one up and blocked my whole family from it so we wouldn't know. 




Cut to last year. More awful behavior, house is being destroyed, my kids and pets are being hurt. I saw on his phone where he told people he was going to kill my husband that day run out of though he house. I packed his shit up, called his dad's girlfriend to get him and that was that. 




The day I found my son's plan to kill my husband, my ex picked up my son's friends and they had a fun weekend. No punishment for it at all, his dad begged me not to call the police. Since then the lying has gotten crazy. His dad is a pathological liar as well and frequently believes the lies he tells. So much so that he told ME that my son ""ran away from home"". Completely rewriting history. He tells everyone what a deadbeat mom I am. He hasn't filed for child support even though I encouraged him to do so. His dad lives with his parents and girlfriend. My son has been there a year now and there has been no improvement. Still failing all classes, way out of control online.. so bad that I don't accept his invite on Facebook whenever he decides to unblock me because I'm embarassed by his use of the f word 200 a day. He posts all day long from school. 




Here's the dilemma. In the past year they have invented the scenerio that my husband is abusive and that my son won't be around him. The last time they saw each other, it was my husband's 40th birthday. I had a major party planned, pig roast, fireworks, live music.. the whole thing. My son came over, busted a hole in the wall, my husband yelled at him for it and he called his dad to pick him up. He never even came to me in the house to say anything about my husband, just left with his dad. Because I didn't chase him and ruin the whole day, I chose my husband over him. Now he won't visit me at all unless I am alone. He won't come over if my husband is here, won't see his siblings at all. If I ask him if he needs things (clothes, shoes, doctor visits, etc) he only wants electronics. New laptop, new iphone. It's not his birthday, it's not anything he just wants electronics because I don't pay child support. 




I've seen my son maybe 4 times this year. They now are playing that the reason why we have no relationship is because of my husband but the truth is, it's because they both need serious mental help and they are seriously bad for my family and my well being. 




I don't want to abandon my son. I don't want to play into the game where he gets to see me only when I'm alone because it gives legitimacy to their false claims of abuse and problems with my husband. (When my son was in 6th grade he told people my husband burned down a garage behind our house, the truth is the landlord moved his stuff in the garage and boarded up the windows to keep it from being stolen... it caused huge issues. He told his principal it is true, he had a deactivated cell phone and made fake texts to himself claiming to be his own drug dealer, that got me some trouble as well). My son is not going to graduate highschool. He just wont. At this rate he couldn't even graduate until he was 20. That's just unrealistic. I don't know what I should be doing in terms of support because I am NOT buying electronics and his dad won't file (probably because he knows I wouldn't owe him much and he loves being able to tell people I'm a deadbeat). 





How do I proceed? I don't think my son stands a chance unless his dad actually dies.


Tl;dr my ex husband has eroded my relationship with my son and they now demand that I see my son alone without my other children or my husband because the lie of the day is that my husband is abusive. If I give in, it will make it seem like there is truth to the claim.

Parenting,child iphone,gfm5au,Feel like throwing in the towel,"I’m a mom of 3 and my youngest is just awful, as the title says I just feel like throwing in the towel. 

Let me preface by saying none of my 3 kids are perfect or even close to it, we all have our flaws. 

My older two are overall respectful, they don’t always like their chores but they do them without attitude. One is an honor roll student (school comes easy, he’s lucky) and the other is an average student who tries very hard and really earns the grades. Neither one of them have been in much trouble, they have bad days though. The worst would be the oldest was suspended in middle school for one day for him and his friends creating a group using school iPads and posting memes in said group that were not appropriate humor for school. The other child got in trouble 4 years ago for not doing school work because it was “too hard”. We discussed it and she busts her butt now, school is still hard but she tries hard. 

My youngest has my head spinning, wondering if some kids are just born “bad”. I just don’t understand what is going on. He’s in 3rd grade. In an effort to make this shorter I will just talk about things that have happened in the past year...

Caught taunting/hurting animals: throwing football or hitting baseball towards horses/goats, calling dogs or cats to him and then throwing water in their face, sitting next to dog while watching TV and I catch him bending the back leg in a way it shouldn’t be bent. He likes to pull legs off various bugs and watch them try to walk with fewer legs. He’s not allowed to be alone with any animals now. 

Three times found evidence of playing with fire, denied every time and tried to convince me that someone snuck into his room and lit matches under his bed and someone was framing him by burning his Uno cards under his bathroom sink. 

Stealing other peoples holiday candy (many many times) after eating all of his and then lying about it. Found the evidence in his room and he just flat out denies it and says he doesn’t know how it got under his bed. 

He gave a boy at school a black eye because he was holding the basketball and it was against the rules so he jumped on kid’s back and repeatedly hit the ball and kid’s face until kid let go of ball. 

He had an old iPhone color (no service) to play games on, I check all the kids electronics it’s a rule that I always have access or it’s cut off immediately. Checking his phone I see he made a video of him pulling his pants down “for the girls”. When confronted he acts like he doesn’t understand why I’m mad because “I didn’t post it! I can’t post on YouTube!” I honestly don’t know where he got that idea from, I use parental controls and my oldest son is gay so I know he didn’t see or hear him making videos for any girls. His sister still plays imagination with LOL Dolls. I’m genuinely at a loss on this one. Also had videos of him jumping on the phone and throwing the phone trying to break it. 

I’ve found my jewelry in his room. He doesn’t know how it got there. 

He’s come home from school with a nice (for a kid) watch. Someone gave it to him. I told him to give it back. A couple months later I found it in his school desk. 

He’s a very manipulative child. We were at a game his sister was cheering at and I over heard him telling someone that works at the school “I can’t play baseball because I have to stay home and take care of grandma so brother and sister can do cheer and track and field.” Not true, he can’t play baseball because of the videos on the phone, that was the punishment as well as losing the phone. 

In the beginning of the school year we took him away for a long weekend for his birthday, just him. He missed two days of school and his teacher made him a make-up packet. He told me that he finished it at school. Report cards came and he’s almost failing! Turns out he’s throwing his make-up and homework away. I didn’t have a way of knowing because his school doesn’t do agendas and the only homework kids have is class work they don’t finish in school. 

I’ve heard him say things to other kids like “I don’t care, I’ll just tell everyone you did it and they’ll believe me.” Sadly, it’s true! I feel like our immediate family are the only ones who sees the real him, everyone thinks he’s an angel and you can’t tell them otherwise. 

Yesterday the kids were working on their school packets and he comes to me and says “I finished this much so I’m not doing anymore today.” I don’t roll that way and I let him know that he was way out of line, he doesn’t get to tell me what he is and isn’t doing. So I told him that he just earned the reward of sitting at the table and finishing ALL  of his work. He later said he was done and I said I would check it tomorrow and we could fix/go over anything that was wrong or he didn’t know. I felt bad, it was a lot of work but he needed to learn a lesson, so I figured I would give him a break without him knowing I was giving him a break by checking the work tomorrow. Well, today came and I find out he didn’t do ANY further work! We were doing pizza and a family movie tonight so he did his school packet instead. 

These are just some key points, this is a daily struggle. This behavior has been going on since he was two (I’m not joking, he started stealing when he was 2. He would get up in the middle of the night and steal everyone’s phone and play until they were dead.) He’s entitled, rude, disrespectful, manipulative, he’s mean to animals and other kids. He truly thinks that he should have the same rights as any adult. If I allow him to do something once he automatically assumes that he can do or have whatever it was forever now. I have to specifically tell him things like “Just because I said you can have a popsicle now doesn’t mean you can have one whenever you feel like it, you still have to ask.” Or “I know grandma said you can watch her TV but that doesn’t mean you can come over anytime and just change the channel on her, you have to ask.” If I don’t say that he always says “Well, it was fine before.” 

I’ve tried rewarding him for being honest and making good choices. I’ve tried spanking him. I’ve made him throw away all his toys, TWICE. Manual labor. Sitting down and trying to talk to him. I’ve tried taking him and doing one on one time. Nothing works for him. 

Do you think some kids are just born bad? He reminds me of my sister when we were growing up, who has Narcissistic and Histrionic Personality Disorder. I just don’t know if there’s much I can do to help him. I’m honestly fearful of when he becomes a teen, I think everyone will be getting locks on our bedrooms doors to sleep. He actually scares me because he seems to have no currency, nothing matters enough to him."
Parenting,child iphone,6ve8fu,Help with Uncontrollable Teenager,"My girlfriend and I are at our wits end and don't know what to do.
A little backstory, my girlfriend and I met about a year ago, fell in love and decided to have a baby together. When I met my girlfriend she currently had an 8 year old son and a 12 year old daughter that I consider my step-children. The point of concern is the 12 year old girl.

From what I've been told she has a condition called Intermittant explosive disorder, a psychology disorder she recieved from her biological father. This causes her to have a short fuse and explode through violence and aggression over even the most mudane things. The only medication that is suggested for her is ""intuitive"" I think thats how its spelt. Which we tried and did nothing for her. But what I want to focus on is two particular incidences that I was actually present for. These were the biggest incidences among multiple minor explosions. 

First one happened about a month ago, it started after she asked to have a sleepover. Her mother said no and this all escalated rather quickly to her saying some of the most disgusting things I ever heard a 12 year old say. (Go burn in hell, I hope you die, I'm going to kill you in your sleep, not to mention a vast collection of curse words) This resulted into a confrontation in which her mother told her to exit to room, she refused to, I stepped in by lifting her up and carrying her to her room. She claimed I abused her and called the police with the new iphone I got her. (Im such a horrible step dad right). 

The second incident  happened yesterday, we both saw it coming. You can see the build up of a explosion like smoke from a volcano before it erupts. She craves the conflict and its only a matter of time before she explodes. Well after recently moving into a beautiful new home my girlfriend and I established one simple rule: No eating in the living room or bedrooms. One rule the 8 year old has no problems following, however, the 12 year old has been trying very hard to break this rule. She was caught 3 times already and was warned, she tried bending the rule by moving the rolling chair to the edge of the dinning room and living room and eating there until I moved that chair into the attic. 

Well yesterday was my last straw, after spending the entire day treating her and her brother she decided to eat her treat in the living room in front of the TV. I approached her and asked her 3 times to eat at the dinning room table, she ignored me. I snatched the food up and said it again. She rolled her eyes at me and looked away. So I turned the tv off. She then said ""Don't you dare turn off the tv on me or you'll be sorry"" this immediately boiled my blood. Nobody disrespects me like that especially a 12 year old. I ripped the xbox from its cord and tossed it onto the couch. Well this escalated into her explosion where she said some of the most disgusting things I've ever heard ANYONE say. Saying im a horrible father, her biological father is better (which let me just saying Im holding my tongue from discussing him in this post I'll tell you that) I shouldn't be with her mother, and even said that she deserves everything in the world (a statement she seems to live by) and then spitting out a collection of lies. She is a pathalogical liar, a habit we are trying to correct. These lies can vary between well thought out the completely rediculous. This particular incident her lies were just beyond rediculous. Ranging from ""She was going to eat at the table but I was in her way"" to ""She was confused and didn't understand what I was asking her"".
 When I wouldn't tolerate or give into her she turned her attention on her brother, on her mother, and even on the dog. When the front door opened she said she hopes he gets hit by a car. When she saw that my girlfriend wasn't taking her side she exploded even more, her words worsen and worsen. She threatened to run away which we told her if she did she isn't welcome back, so she resorted to hiding in her room. Now there is a 6 phase formula with her that I've come to recognize:

1. The explosion phase: Initial explosion involving physical violence and vulgar language 

2. The storm away phase : She storms off, either runs away or into her room. This is where she plans for the next step

3. Malice phase : She intends to emotionally hurt as many individuals as possible, even with passive aggression. 

4. The Victim phase: She returns claiming she is being victimized, stating she is the black sheep, she is being abused, that there is something wrong with her and its out of her control. 

5. The Nothing Happened Phase: She returns happy, playful, and upbeat claiming nothing of importance just happened. It was ""no big deal"". This phase is replaced with a worried weeping if there is a chance that she may have actually hurt someone. 
6. The remorseful phase: This phase is where she resorts to almost a child-like demeanor and is remorseful and apologetic. Wanting to hug and cuddle. Now her mother and I both know she isn't actually remorseful, she just hates the silent treatment we give her. It's one of the most affective weapons . We call her out on it which results in her storming away a few more times in anger before we just let it go and ""believe her"". 

Anyways Im here to see what advice I can get, also what I personally should do from here. Im not ready to forgive her and with the way she treated me and the things she said I don't even know when I'll be able to. It has become a known fact it will happen again within a month or so, I don't know how to react because today is my birthday and I know she will want to be involved in the celebration but I personally am not ready to forgive her, and I cant forsee when I will be. Her behavior makes you see her in an entirely new light. The sweet, smart, playful teenager is replaced by this malicious person. 
"
Parenting,child iphone,6k2xhv,Drastic measures needed for out of control daughter [6/F/Adopted but blood related],"Backstory:  Our adopted daughter is actually my 1st cousin's(mom's sister's daughter) child.  Let's call my cousin Erin and our adopted daughter (Erin's biological daughter) Natalie.  Erin has always been a very troubled child.  In fact, that entire side of my family has issues and my childhood was full of emotional outbursts, alcoholism, unhappy marriages, depression, etc.  I have no idea how I am the only one relatively normal, but probably because my dad was able to get custody of me when I was 11.   Anyways, Erin was a smart child with a sweet side to her, but as she got older she began to get out of control and her mother was almost as bad so she was not really able to control her.  She spend most of age 10-17 at boarding schools and in and out of detention centers.  By the time she was an adult, she was a drug addict that slept around and engaged in all sorts of unhealthy behaviors.  She had her first child in 2000 and my grandparents adopted him because Erin couldn't take care of him.  He has been a major problem child who is already in trouble with the law, abusing drugs, etc. 

All this backstory to introduce Natalie, who Erin had in 2011 with a random guy she slept with.  At this point I barely ever heard from her, but through my aunt I learned that Erin went to jail for possession of meth and other charges and Natalie who was about a year old was currently living in a home of one of Erin's drug buddies.  A very unhealthy situation.

My wife [F/34 at the time] and I [M/30 at the time] did not have any children but our hearts hurt for this child and we decided to take action.  Erin granted us temporary custody of the child at 14 months old and eventually we permanently adopted her even though Erin is out of jail (and has never bothered to come visit Natalie)

Sorry for the long backstory but its important to know where my wife and I are coming from.  We knew that Natalie would be a difficult child going in due to the fact that a) she has the crazy gene my side of the family seems to have and b) although we cannot confirm it we are 99.99% sure that Erin was using meth, smoking, drinking and who knows what else while pregnant with Natalie which through research we knew could lead to cognative issues much less behavioral ones.

That said, my wife and I are both stable people, and we believed in nurture over nature meaning we thought we could be a loving caring family that helped her overcome any behaviorial issues.  For the first few years she was a relatively normal child, had a bit of extra energy that other children seemed to have but we figured she was on the right path.  But by the time she was 4, she started getting in trouble at day care, stealing, lying, acting out, ignoring things that we told her.  Her kindergarden experience last year was very rocky, she was constantly in trouble, we had several parent teacher meetings and in general her behavior was escalating.  She has had difficulty controlling her emotions (throwing things, shes broken 2 ipad screens and an iphone screen during tantrums among other things, screaming, trying to hurt us and others).  Now things are escalating to the point where she screams swear words at us (she screamed at my wife and called her a 'dumb bitch' the other day).  I have no idea where she even knows those words.  And also she has now taken to walking out of the house in anger when we turn our backs and roaming the neighborhood until we frantically find her.

Adding to our challenges, we have 15 month old twin boys at home.  The challenges of raising twins is something on its own difficult, and I think part of her acting out is not getting as much attention as she is used to.  Having twin infants has also caused us to lose control of the situation more than a few times when parenting her because she knows exactly what to do to get us to cave on things, for instance purposely waking up the babies from a nap that we so desperately need them to take for our sanity.  I am not proud to admit that we've lost a bit of control and caved when we knew that it would hurt us long term in controlling her just because we did not want to make things more difficult in the short term.

Not sure if anyone is still reading this but we feel like our control over Natalie is slipping away quickly.  Any punishments have no effect on her, no matter how consistent we are with it.  We are afraid that she is turning into her biological mother and will become a lost cause.  It keeps us up at night worrying about it.  We are starting to think that we need to do something drastic to halt this escalating danger.

We are looking for any advice, tips, etc from this sub.  If anyone has had a similar problem child please let me know what you have tried. 

These are the sort of things that we've tried:

* Do not display anger, always be in control of the situation (this has slipped considerably since my sons were born)
* Make punishments consistent, do not punish unless she was specifically warned beforehand and told of the punishment she will receive if she disobeys
* Reward her for good behaviors
* She has been to a child psychologist for the last year to work on feelings.  She knows the right steps to take to calm herself down, but in the heat of the moment she loses control of her emotions and lashes out
* Psychologist has diagnosed her as ADHD but thus far we have strongly preferred to avoid medication

Overall we are at wit's end and very scared about the future with Natalie.  Any advice is much appreciated!


EDIT:  Guys, I want to thank you all so much for all the responses, support and advice.  It has been overwhelming and my wife and I are so appreciative.  I wish I could respond to everyone but anyone who took the time to reply please know that I've read every response and taken your advice to heart.

It seems pretty clear based on the responses that the first step is to get her on ADHD meds ASAP.  I guess we had a misconception about them, and our while our daughter's therapist did encourage us to try meds, she did say that we might be able to work on things via just therapy to see if it helps.  It doesnt.

Also there are some great suggestions on how to work on my daughter's behavior without giving her punishments that either don't work or make things worse.  The key focus for us should be to help her control her emotions - especially anger - and figure out what works.  As I said before she knows methods to help her cope when shes getting angry, given to her by the therapist, but some of the methods suggested are worth trying.  

So thanks again guys and I will provide an update in the future, which will hopefully be a good update :)"
Parenting,child iphone,d0iurx,My 10yr old daughter just doesn’t know and doesn’t care about anything,"
When ever she does anything wrong and we ask her about it she just doesn’t know. It was usually small things like she doesn’t know why she didn’t turn her homework in, why she didn’t even do her homework, or why she takes out her clean clothes and put them in the basket of dirty clothes because they were in her way of what she wanted to wear etc, etc. She just don’t know.
  She started back to school this week in the 5th grade.  First day is taking back all paper work she don’t know why she didn’t turn them in even when her teacher asked for them. Then things started getting more serious.
   Day two a girl told her to go steal a soda from the teachers lounge. Kids are not allowed in this room there’s no reason she should of been in that area so they were just roaming the halls. She don’t know why she did it and she doesn’t care because she was with her friend so it was ok cause her friend told her. 
   Day three yesterday she sneaks her iPhone to school on the walk home she looses it. By the time her sister told us it was gone. Apparently someone told her to bring her phone to school even though she knows she can’t bring it because she constantly shows how irresponsible she is. She just shrugged her shoulders when we asked her about it. She doesn’t care that she lost her phone that her grandpa is still paying on, she will not be getting another phone. She doesn’t know why she snuck her phone.  She is completely not phased by it.
  If my 13 yr old lost her phone she would freak out which seems to be a logical reaction but my 10 yr old is like eh whatever.

Is anyone else’s kids like this? How can go you about getting your child to understand they need to care about things and I don’t know is not an answer especially when you know.

Considering putting her back in therapy and see if she has ideas."
Parenting,child iphone,9em0m8,Looking for opinions on reform school?,"Without making this super long. I have a 15 year old daughter who has become out of controll. She posts sexy pics to social media and has opened about 20 different accounts to try and deviate us. She steals from her mom and me. 

Her mom and I are separated and both live with someone else. We both have another child. She has a sister that I have with her mom. 

They are half and half at my place and their moms. 

She despises me because I take her things away. She used to have everything in her room. Tv, radio, Xbox one , cell phone etc. But since she can't be trusted I have taken everything away except for her books. 

I have tried everything and her mom too. She gets violent when I try talking to her and if I protect myself she says that I hit her. I do not. She has busted holes in the wall in her room. Completely disrespects our rules. Never helps out around the house. 

I recently got her a part time job thinking it would help but it seems to have made things worse. Just yesterday she threw a tennis racket at me because I refused to give her a ride to the store. (I has just found a missing iPhone in her room that I had to repair for a friend. It was in my nightstand in my room, she said she never touched it but she took it. She steals make up from my gf etc. I sent her to her mom's because I didn't want it to blow up again in front of the other kids. 

I will never give up on her but it's really causing me to not sleep and putting a huge damper on our lifestyle at home. The same at her mom's. 

Is reform or military school a viable option. Something where she says there during the week and comes home on weekends? I'm near Ottawa Ontario so I'm not sure if my options. "
Parenting,child iphone,3znz2f,HELP! My (48F) children (10 & 12) are hearing mean things about me from their stepmom (48F) and I don't know what else to do,"Hi there, Thanks for reading this. I hope you can help me with this issue.

First some Background
My ex (49M) husband and I split up 7 years ago and he has since married (stepmom 48F) who has her own son (12M) with Aspergers and ADHD. They have been together for 6 years. I was single for 4 years and then reconnected with my first boyfriend (48M) who I've been with since. He bought a new house with his wife and I bought him out of the family home.
Divorce was kept amicable for the children and we had an agreement to NEVER speak badly of each other when the kids were around. So far I had thought this was being held to but I've since found out that Stepmom has been speaking badly of me in front of the kids for some time.


Current situation

My ex's parents are visiting from O/S this week and the kids have been with him for an extended period of time. Stepmom isn't the most patient person and can be so aggressive with my kids. We also have completely different styles. Mine is more accepting and forgiving, hers more judgey. For example previously my daughter had asked me about our differences as she works full time and I contract. I explained that everyone has different parenting styles and priorities regarding their children. Her priority is to get the best for her son (he has multiple iPads, an iPhone and goes to a private school) where as mine is about childhood and experience so I sacrifice things to be there to pick them up from school and allow them to have play dates and other experiences. My daughter has a new mobile phone as she's starting high school this year and she received my hand me down iPhone 4. Neither is right, they are just different.


God, I hope I'm not rambling now!


So today I received a text from my daughter saying that her Grand dad had asked Stepmom what I did for a job and she said 'not much' and some other things then dismissed the children with a 'you can leave the room' before saying more. My daughter was very upset as she had said some terrible things and then dismissed them like servants (her words). I answered her by saying that Stepmom was wrong to speak like that but she should be the bigger person because Stepmom knows nothing about our home and how it works.


However I then text my ex the following
""I thought we had an agreement to not talk badly about each other in front of the children. Child 12 is upset that Stepmom said something mean about me to the grandparents. Whether or not our children have flappy ears does not give anyone permission to say mean things. Stepmom should apologise to Child 12 and I would like an apology too. Now""


Am I wrong? Obviously I don't have control over their household but I felt that I needed to step in here.


Also, what do I do if Stepmom doesn't apologise to Child 12? Or to me? Do I make a big deal about this?


I would really love some advice from others who may have similar experiences or advice.

Thank you


EDIT :  I've never interfered with ex's household before. When my children complain about things previously I've always given them different points of view and asked them to talk to their father about it"
Parenting,child iphone,3jup8c,Totally new parent to a 7 year old - have questions,"Due to complicated reasons I won't get into, boyfriend and I are now the guardians of his 7 year old niece. Her mother is incarcerated and no one knows who her father is. She has been judged psychologically sound with no major trauma impact from her situation, and is otherwise a normal, sweet girl, but nevertheless she has also presented some behavioral problems that we're not quite sure how to solve. Need advice from seasoned parents.

1. Lying. She is a habitual liar, she never stops talking and half the things she says are little attention-seeking white lies, like how all the kids in school push her and hit her (teacher says no such thing happens and her ""injuries"" are always invisible), and how they all were given iPhones or iPads by their awesome parents (7 year old kids... I highly doubt it).

She also doesn't tell us when she does something bad, like spill a drink or get soap all over the bathroom. Instead she will try to pre-emptively deflect/distract us by coming and accusing us of doing something bad to HER, like throwing a fit because I ""took too long"" to make dinner and now she's starving. And when we eventually find the spilled drink, she will deny it to the grave, and talk about me taking too long with dinner again. How do we get her to be honest?

2. Taking stuff. She thinks she has the right to anything in our apartment, and is constantly playing with my makeup or eating any food she wants out of the fridge and messing up the clothes in the wardrobe. We have told her again and again what is her stuff, our stuff, and off limits stuff, but she just waits till we're not looking before playing with the off limits stuff. And again, strongly denying it when asked. Or smiling a cutesy, meaningless ""sorry!"" and flouncing away when caught red-handed. How do we get her to take our words seriously without resorting to screaming or harsh punishment?

3. Trouble making friends. I read that only child syndrome is a myth, but this kid is a perfect stereotype of it. She is selfish, demanding, not very empathetic, and as a result she has difficulty making friends at school. She is a very outgoing kid, but that only makes her a bit of a bully as we have witnessed her bulldozing her way into groups of playing children and demanding the game to be played her way with everyone playing the role she dictates or she would cry and scream (very loudly and fakely) and come running to us saying the other kids were saying mean things to her. They weren't, we were watching. The lying again.

We're at a loss, and completely new to this. Please help us!"
Parenting,child iphone,1umu18,"My ex-husband is not paying child support and instead buying my children expensive gifts, causing resentment. Advice on dealing with it?","My ex and I have 2 children, ages 9 and 11. We've been divorced for about 3 years. My ex is, at this point, about 8 months behind on child support. I have talked to my lawyer about this and we are working on it, but the courts are, as many may know, incredibly slow. I earn about enough money to take care of bills, pay my kids' private school tuition (which he is supposed to pay half of, but hasn't paid for this year yet), and buy food. I'm living pretty much pay check to pay check despite the fact that I make almost $80,000/year.

Despite the fact that he is not paying child support, which he claims is due to slow business (he owns a contracting company), this past christmas he still found the money to buy my son (9) an ipad, a nintendo 3ds, and an iphone. He also bought my daughter a laptop and a new iphone. I, on the other hand, had to ask my mother for extra money so I could buy them a few gifts that were not nearly as nice.

This isn't a one time occurrence. He moved out of state after the divorce and every time he comes to see them, he'll show up with some extravagant present and take them out shopping for things I can't afford to buy and to restaurants I can't afford to pay for. I've talked to him about not buying them these things (without bringing up the child support issue, as that's a headache I'll leave to the lawyers) and he consistently tells me to lighten up and that he buys them things because he only gets to see them once a month.

I can't help but feel a lot of resentment when I see my kids use this stuff. I want to give them these things, but I can't. I don't know if it would hurt as much if he was contributing with child support or if it would still hurt as much. Sometimes it's all I can do to not lash out and take all of the gifts away. I've already had to take away the laptop once because my daughter was using it after bedtime on a school night and she (understandably at her age) used the ""you can't take that away from me, my dad gave it to me"" strategy.

I don't know what to do. I want my kids to have nice things, I really do, but I hate the fact that he gets to buy their love with expensive gifts while I'm stuck footing the bill for everything else. How do I get through this without resorting to immaturity?

**TL;DR: Ex-husband doesn't pay child support, buys our kids gifts I can't afford. I feel he is trying (and generally succeeding) to buy their love. This makes me want to take the gifts away from my children.**

Parenting,child iphone,88ifzu,What do I do with my 3.5 year old while breastfeeding my new baby in public?,"I had my second child on March 21, and it occurred to me this morning that not only do I have to get used to breastfeeding in public again, but that I'll have to keep my three-and-a-half-year-old corralled at the same time. Any suggestions on how to keep her occupied? We don't let her watch videos on iPhones or iPads, and I'm not sure I have room in the diaper bag for books. I'm thinking notebook and crayons, but I'm worried she'll get bored with that after a while."
Parenting,child iphone,afhvzp,How carefully do you control/filter what your kid watches on youtube?,"Our 8 year old recently inherited my old iphone (now it just has wifi and works as a youtbe-machine)

Her new weekend morning routine is to wake up and spend a few hours watching youtube with headphones on. She absolutely loves it and it's been a nice break from loud TV in the mornings.

Previously, we were careful with what types of movies she was allowed to watch on TV. We don't even have cable, just dozens of DVDs (but this is just because the cable company wasn't able to actually give us cable as we live in a certain part of town that it doesn't reach).

For instance, she saw our DVD cover of Beetlejuice and was begging and begging to watch it when she was 7. We said no way, because it was inappropriate, had sex jokes, etc. But we let her see things like The Goonies, Ghostbusters, etc. We aren't THAT strict, just careful. 

Well, she started out with the old iphone by watching kid-friendly Roblox videos, barbie videos, etc. I figured Youtube was pretty harmless and didn't really control what she was seeing because so far everything she saw was on kid channels. 

This morning she came into my room and told me ""I'm seeing something funny!"" and basically told me it was a Minecraft ""in real life"" video where they showed cows in Minecraft having a baby, and then in real life (which was a somewhat blurry video of cows having sex with saxophone music playing over it and a ""censored"" bar). She went to go have breakfast so I immediately watched part of the video. it was... definitely not for 8 year olds. Maybe more for a 12 year old. There was a part where a building fell down, and in the ""real"" version they played ISIS music and well.. it's not for kids.


I grabbed my SO and told him about it and he didn't seem to care so much. He told me ""well... kids tend to filter things so I don't think she knows what she's seeing"" and I said ""sure, but we did a really good job making sure she saw appropriate things with DVDs, and now she watches hours of whatever she wants?"" and he said ""so what should we do then?"" and I said I didn't know. Daughter is still watching the same video right now as I type this and SO has seemed to completely forget about the issue. 


I have no idea what is right here. It seems like my husband is not bothered by this at all, but I think it's not a good idea that she has unfiltered access to any crap on youtube, especially now that this morning she's seen cows having sex, a joke ISIS video... like... she's 8 but she's still a child.

But, I don't know what to do about it. What would you do? How much do you monitor what your kid sees on youtube?"
Parenting,child iphone,c9brgq,Is my Stepson spoiled/ manipulative like i think?,"I'm 25M my stepson is 7.  I've been with his mother for 3 years and in my opinion he is a spoiled brat who wants everything his way. 

In the past two years he has lived with me and his mother , his grandmother , and his auntie.  Everywhere is something wrong with the adults.   I will Admit his auntie and grandmother spoil him terribly but it reaches a point where a child is held accountable and not all blamed on parents..

When he stayed with us he was extremely disrespectful to his mother , he would tell at her slams doors even yell that she better stop if he recieves a spanking , it got to where he refused to eat real food only would eat chips and fruit snacks , if he didn't recieve them or got grounded he would contact his aunt complaining how he wants to live there and didn't like me...


He moved with the grandmother next and within 2 months she felt that he was depressed and emotionally ruined because he couldn't sleep in the bed with his mother 247 and was jealous, so then it was best if she left me to focus on him.

 Lastly he moved with his auntie he got everything Multiple iPhones ,  water parks and arcades every weekend everything .  he started having trouble in school he's also began beating up his little brothers who are babies for no reason. He failed the 1st grade this year.     My fiance blames everyone for failing him and thinks he is just so innocent,  how do i get her to see her son is just a spoiled manipulative brat ? 

 She thinks he acts this way because his dad isn't around despite the fact that he has me and a really great grandfather there for him 247"
Parenting,child iphone,8ocuc5,Is this family a bad influence on my daughter or is it me?,"My 16 year old daughter and i have issues. Im a single mother, i have next to no support and i work. In the past year I've had my marriage fall apart (not my daughter's father, i was remarried) in a very painful and difficult way. Then my daughter witnessed a family freind sexually assault a little girl, which we've become involved with the police and DCP, Aussie CPS, affidavits have been written etc. My daughter also went through bullying at school last year. So its been an awful time for both of us in particular my daughter. She has begged me to be home schooled like her freind but because i work, the education department won't allow it. They have only given us the option of a private college with programs designed for kids going through difficult stuff. In Australia kids have to be engaged in education and training until 12th grade, she is in 10th. Not sending her to some form of schooling is illegal and considered child neglect.

She spends a lot of time with her freind who is being home schooled, lets call her Sarah. She's a lovely girl with her own issues, she also went through bullying and her mum, lets call her Jessica, has recently left her father. Apparently there was domestic violence, he was unfaithful and even drugged her to go and see his mistress.

Sarah and Jessica have been there for my daughter a lot, Jessica is a stay at home mum and they all hang out a lot together. Jessica offered to home school my daughter for me but the rules say no, i have to, and as i mentioned, i work and am not in a position to live off welfare. Also, i did not finish school so I'm not educated enough to educate her. Every time my daughter stays there she gets angry at me that she can't home school and that i don't spend enough time with her. Its true, i dont, between work and all the stress ive been under its hard. I suffer from depression, yes im getting help, but to cope with work and all this school and legal stuff i do spend a lotof time alone. Much of the time we do spend together she will bring up all the things she resents about me and i just shut down because im so stressed. Im doing my best but its not enough. I feel like Jessica and sarah are so supportive that they are fuelling these resentments even if they aren't intending to. 

Since Jessica left her husband, she has been driving around looking for her husband, to catch him with his mistress. She takes my daughter and her daughter sarah along on these excursions, often late at night. My daughter loves the excitement and drama of it of it. Recently her iphone screen got damaged while they were running back to their car in case he saw them. Cost me nearly  $200 to fix. I don't have a high paid job. It had only been repaired a few weeks prior. I dont know how she expects me to quit my job, go on unemployment and maintain her iphone, buy her converse sneakers, pay for her internet, and provide her with all the stuff she wants. 

I guess my concern is, i feel that her freinds environment is not helping our situation. She just seems so much more resentful when she's been there that im not in a position to stay home and home school her. 

Also, i feel that with all that is going on in my daughter's life that this following the violent ex husband is not healthy, or safe! Jessica insists that he'd never do anything while my daughter and sarah are there but this is a man who allegedly drugged his wife with ketamine! If he is so dangerous and she is scared of him, why would she go out at night and stalk him? I've had a drama queen freind before who claimed domestic violence and acted similarly. As opposed to my sister who left her hubby due to DV and avoided him like the plague, would not engage with him, etc. Im concerned about Jessicas state of mind if she is engaging in this risky behavior, and im starting to think it's a bad influence on my daughter. 

Advice and thoughts please."
Parenting,child iphone,ciqqmb,Dealing with your husbands ex wife,"Quick back story, I’ve been with my husband for 6 years. We each have kids from a previous marriage and one child together. I came from an abusive relationship and expected coparenting to be difficult with my ex, but it took us about a year. We aren’t friends, but we can be at the same events together for the kids. As far as our blended family, we have worked very hard at developing good relationships between us and all the kids. While I would never try and replace their mom, in my home those are my babies. Everyone has same rules and expectations, no matter who your biological parent is. They are all loved and treated the same by both myself and my husband as well as our families. 

The first 3 years with my husband we dealt with a lot of crazy from his ex wife. Hundreds of calls a day (not exaggerating the hundreds), in and out of family court every other month, she worked as a medical assistant and accessed my medical files, took my social security number and used it (and subsequently told the kids I was trying to ruin her life when the medical office pressed charges), multiple CPS calls against me - some totally fabricated stories and some for medical abuse for giving a prescribed medication as prescribed for bad allergic reaction. When I got pregnant she told the kids I stole her baby. I had my step son asking me how I cut the baby out of mommy’s belly and put it in mine. Multiple times police showed up for “well checks”, she posted things about me on my works company Facebook page, broke into my husbands email and filed a restraining order because she found out we had made a will. Faked an attack to get my husband to go to her house because the kids were there and then proceeded to try to sleep with him and got upset he called the cops because she claimed she’d been attacked. I could keep going and going. We eventually relocated our family an hour away when she moved and started court battles over the kids schools. We were just done with the drama. The list goes on and on and on. 

I’ve done pretty well at keeping my calm through all of that. I’ve not engaged in the drama, we got it court ordered for all communication to go through family wizard, changed our time sharing so almost all exchanges are through school and the rest happen at the police station. 

The kids are now 13 and 14 and have been coming home more and more upset about things she’s saying to them. I could care less what she thinks of us and my husband feels the same. But it hurts the kids and that is what is eating at me. She continues to tell them all about the “abuse” she suffered through and how he beat her and beat her while pregnant. Now I do know she’s thrown knives and things at him with the kids in the room, but I will never pretend to have been in their marriage or witnessed all of it myself. I can just say in 6 years he’s never given me even reason to suspect he would ever be violent with me. 

One of the kids called her out because her stories keep changing. You know before you used to say he never hit you in the face or head but now you’re saying you’re partially deaf because he beat you in the head. Had one of the kids convinced we had her cell phone bugged and were listening to all her calls. My husband stopped even calling the kids when they are with her because of how she made them feel (would sit next to them leaning in to listen and grilling them or get upset if they didn’t tell her every word).  And now she’s started telling the kids friends these stories. 

Their step dad over there treats them horribly. Their mom is now talking about divorce and she’s never getting married again. She told the kids the only reason my in laws just moved down here was to ruin her life. My step son said I asked mom why can’t you just let it go and move on? Why do you have to keep bringing it up and talking about them when they don’t even mention your name. She says I’ll never get over it, he’s my abuser and I’m forced to deal with him and relive his abuse over and over again. She said they’ve hacked into everything of mine. To the point they aren’t allowed to connect to WiFi at her house in fear we will be able to watch them or see what she’s doing in her house. Says we are stalking her. Downloaded a tracking app on the kids phones that we pay for. We deleted it and did the share my location on their iPhones with her because frankly don’t give a damn, she can know where her kids are that’s fine. 

Then she sends them here this week with a message for us. If we are going to start shit with her to tell us to go get more food stamps. Which is hilarious because we don’t get state assistance. In fact I have covered all their healthcare costs for 6 years even though she was court ordered to. Again, in my home they are my babies. 

We only communicate about school and medical. That’s it. We allow her extra time on our days for special events. It’s pretty sparse communication. She’s logged into the family wizard 2,749 times this year compared to our 426. 

I’m just exhausted with it. I do my best to ignore, we don’t engage back, literally have ignored her. We are polite at school events, say hello, but that’s the extent. And for every time the kids to come home and vent for hours about the crazy crap my mom did and said this week is just exhausting. One minute she’d still be with my husband if I hadn’t wrecked their home. (They weren’t together when we got together).  The next he’s an abuser torturing her. Why do people act this way? And why in the hell do you put your own children through that nonsense because you’re obsessed or can’t let go?"
Parenting,child iphone,7gkul9,5 tips control smartphone addiction in your kids,"I am a mother of a 6 year-old-boy and at some point I feel like he has relied on electronic device too much. I have to constantly keeps my eyes on him so that he won’t touch the iPad or iPhone.  But we all know that this isn’t a good idea. So I’ve found some effective ways to distract him. 

1) I organized interesting physical activities that he can enjoy. It can be a family outing, taking him to the library, inviting his friends for overnight stay or riding a bike together - anything that can get him put the phone down.

2) It’s undeniable that books are great for kids. So I bought books which seem to be interesting for my son, they can be books about animal, fairy tales, science and so on. This is a great way to cut down electronic time for my kid, and gradually, he now gains the habit of reading books

3) I have certain area in the house electronic device-free, for example, no one is allowed to use smartphone on the dining table, even me and my husband. That way my son can see that we are setting a good example of using phone moderately.

4) I also try to spend more quality time with him. I would ask him about his day at school, his hobbies or even about the book he was reading. And of course, he would forget about the smartphone time, and I get to know my son better.

5) However, it isn’t easy to get you kid completely give up on playing on smartphone. That’s why I try to limit the time he spends on iPhone as little as possible. I have games like ABC learning or Number learning by Vkids, which are educational and interactive to my child  installed on my iPhone and iPad, so that he can make good use of the time instead of watching some nonsense videos on Youtube that I can’t control or playing violent or inappropriate games.

These tips works well for me and my kids, hope that it can be helpful to all moms here. And if you have any better ideas, please share it here.

Parenting,child iphone,6gthxu,Snapchat and Social Media Lying,"Hello, this is my first time posting here, but I read and lurk quite a bit. Over the weekend I was faced with a huge issue with the younger of my two girls (12). She is a very bright, very socially engaged young woman. She does excellently at school and has a multitude of friends. At home she has typical tween attitude with eye rolling and scoffing at us from time to time. We deal with that as it comes. She has a pattern of lying, behaving underhandedly, and two years ago we caught her stealing money from us. After about 6 months in therapy, it seemed to be better. She had a smartphone and then lost it, didn't tell us for 6 weeks that it was lost. She had a hand-me-down phone and she lost it again (over a year later), she got it back after a 4-month absence. We had set a rule for her with social media, that one, we had to preapprove any social media she wanted to engage in, that we could monitor it at anytime, and three, she was not allowed to open new social media accounts without our permission. I gave the go-ahead on Instagram, Pinterest, Whatsapp, Music.ly, and a few others like Polyvore, etc. I said no to Snapchat. A year ago she downloaded Snapchat against our wishes and decided to hide it from us (of course), we found out when older sister (age 16) told us.  I deleted the app, changed her password, and she did it again. This time I changed the iTunes password, I put major parent restrictions on her phone and talked with her about the risks of Snapchat and how it made me uncomfortable, how social media can be lots of fun, but you have to be careful with it, etc. We are pretty permissive parents overall, but her pattern behavior has suggested that she cannot be trusted.  

Fast forward to May of this year. She is/was using an iPhone 5S and it broke completely. The battery died, the screen shattered, and it stopped working. Rather than repairing it or buying her a new phone, we set up a plan for her to ""earn"" a phone (my old iPhone 6) with a point system. She was/has been doing amazingly well earning her points, she set herself on a schedule. In the meantime, she had asked to borrow my iPad to log on to Instagram. I said it was fine. She's been keeping in touch with her friends an video chatting via Google Hangouts (regular occurrence). On Sunday she had plans to attend a friend's bday party. Then I opened my phone and was looking through my photos because I wanted to show my husband something. I saw a bunch of screenshots of her chats with her friends. And a few Snapchats. In one of the screenshots, her user name on Snapchat had been modified to ""DaughtersFirstName_CUM waterdroplets, tongue emoji"". I was so taken aback. I am a very open mother with both girls, they both know about sex, the mechanics, etc. I don't want them to feel shameful about having sexual feelings and what not. But to have my child's name sexualized like that I was floored. So when I confronted her about it, she proceeded to tell me that a boy that she is connected to on Snapchat changed her name like that and then sent her the screen shot. I confirmed this with several of her friends. She said she was very upset about it and it really bothered her. We talked ad nauseum about responsibility, trust, how she did not have permission to use Snapchat, and one of my fears was that she would be harassed or engaged in a sexual predatory way. My husband and I went over how this was sexual harassment, and it was uncalled for and could be considered illegal. I reiterated with her that nobody gets to slut shame her, her body is her own, and she should never be okay with harassment like this. She really wanted to just ""sweep it under the rug"" because she was embarrassed. We talked about sexual relationships, about being safe, and that if she is considering becoming physical with someone it was important that she talk to me (us) without the fear or shame because feeling a sexual drive is natural and normal. 

We then took the iPad away and reiterated the no Snapchat thing (didn't let her go to the bday party). Afterward, after much crying and sobbing on her part, she spent the rest of the day in her room. I went through her chats on Snapchat and all of it is pretty benign. And now I'm feeling uber guilty and awful for being so strict with her in the first place. Ironically enough, I had planned on talking with her about allowing the Snapchat once she earned her phone. But now I'm conflicted about standing my ground or allowing her access. The bigger issue is the lying and hiding, the smaller issue is that it was actually Snapchat. Any advice welcome!"
Parenting,child iphone,713c7u,Parents of Reddit: Make sure your child is using Do Not Disturb While Driving in the car,"Hello r/parenting!

Just wanted to make a quick PSA about a new iPhone feature that’s coming out today with the release of iOS 11. If your son or daughter has an iPhone, they’re going to have access to a new feature called [Do Not Disturb While Driving](https://www.payetteforward.com/do-not-disturb-while-driving-iphone-safety-feature-explained/), which will silence all calls, texts, and other notifications while you’re driving.

I strongly believe this feature will *save lives*. We all know the dangers of calling/texting while driving, and this new feature will help stop drivers from getting distracted.

This is an issue that hits close to home as many people from my school district (back when I was in high school) got into accidents because of distracted driving. Sometimes they were the ones being distracted, other times they were the victims.

So parents, please please please make sure your child is using Do Not Disturb While Driving when they’re on the road!"
Parenting,child iphone,9mkvkr,Social media and preteens,"       I had my daughter when I was seventeen. I am currently 29 and she is hitting the preteen stage. This year she began middle school as a 6th grader. I strictly told her no instagram or snap chat and explained my reasoning. Too much adult content, as I am an active Social media Millennial and have witnessed. She used musically which I had access to. Since she’s had her iPhone I gave her the Benefit of the doubt and didn’t intrude on her privacy. 

      One day out of curiosity, I did go through her apps and found both a snap chat and instagram! I was livid! I grounded her from the phone which put nothing but stress on getting ahold of her while I was at work or she was at school. (Primary reason for the phone) I decided after a few weeks to give her the phone back. Talked with her about why these rules are in place. Life went on and things seemed great between us as a mother and daughter. 

      One day After school I walked into her room and flopped myself on her bed. She grabbed her phone and ran out. As I turned over and noticed her obvious antics, I yelled for her to bring me her phone. She yells from the hallway “coming!” I got up and went to the hallways to find her frantically deleting stuff. I snatched the phone and caught her mid delete of the same apps! And Lord knows what else! Sooooo frustrating! Grounded again! At this point I did research and noticed that with the new iPhone update I’m able to block content, websites, and limit apps. She currently isn’t able to even have her musically and allowed 1 hour a day on apps. It locks at 8pm-7am. Etc. 

    From what I seen in her phone and her telling me is: she is the only one out of her friends that isn’t allowed to use these apps. Am I being unreasonable? We live in a rural area in New Mexico and everyone knows everyone. My friends children (some younger) have social media’s and I’m like how? My logic is she should live her childhood life to its extent. She’s 11, I feel like social media should wait till she’s a teenager if not older.  I’m curious? What are other parents outlook on social media? Age? How lenient are you with your child? What are some tips to teach her about social media? "

Parenting,child iphone,57jcuk,I'm pretty sure my son participated in stealing an iPhone,"I posted this to the stepparents sub but folks thought I'd get more input here. I've also found out more info since I originally posted:

We cannot find the iPhone, although this iPhone literally followed my foster sons whereabouts yesterday from the boys and girls club to our house last night. Police came to investigate and we allowed them to search the house because we do not want to be one of those parents who tried to cover up a child's wrongs. Police found nothing but the phones last position was for sure at our house.
This child's biomom taught him to steal and he has grown up in a culture where stealing and never admitting wrong are approved of.
I really feel sick over this. I do know phones can erroneously ping but they don't follow individuals around for no reason.

Basically, child a stole iPhone and passed it off to my son. My son brought it home and has hidden it and turned it off. He is black and has been conditioned to never admit anything to the police or authorities. I explained to him they have enough circumstantial evidence to make us pay for this iPhone possibly in a civil suit.
He now says I talk like the police and is very mad at me. (I expect him to be mad at me.)
My guess is that he has now demolished or hidden the phone and it cannot be given back to the original owner. The kids at the boys and girls club apparently wanted him to give back the iPhone so no one would get in trouble and because he won't, his stuff has been stolen today.
I explained to him why they did this. It's like he never thought about this being the reason why he is suddenly missing stuff."
Parenting,child iphone,1qmu8r,"Hello everyone of r/Parenting, I have a question about discipline for you.","I am not a parent yet and to be honest it is a ways off in my life but I really enjoy learning about parenting and know I want to be an amazing Dad.

I recently was browsing through reddit and came across [This comment thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/1qm6ru/its_both_enriching_and_leverage/) about disciplining children by giving them something nice just to take it away as punishment later. The comment thread seems to have the majority of people agreeing with it as a proper parenting method but I was a little taken back.

I know there is no one way is the right way but I have met people through my life who were disciplined like this and they seemed to be ""controlled"" by their parents. Often friends would say they could not do something or were afraid to do something because **BLANK** would get taken away from them. To me I would hope that my kids would be along the lines of ""I can't do that, I really should do what I need to because its the right thing and my parents wouldn't approve of **BLANK**."" I have just seen many kids turn into materialistic controlled individuals from this parenting method and it is not a desirable quality in the friends that have it.

Recently with my job I was interacting with a kid in swimming lessons who broke down and began to cry. I asked what was wrong and why she wouldn't swim and she responded with ""If I don't stay in lessons my daddy is going to take my iPhone away."" I was completely taken back because this was a 6 year old child and I did not agree with how it affected her. I began thinking about it a lot and how this girl is turning out to be a spoiled little girl who is controlled by materialistic items that at her age I did in no way support her having. 

My parents occasionally used this method on me as well and I do not deny that with children there is a lot of benefits from reward and punishment style learning but what are your opinions on it? 

For me it depends on the parents using it; as some may do a better job and others may end up with those spoiled kids who are easily controlled by having their items taken away.

What other discipline styles do you use and would you change this one at all? 

Thanks for reading this."
Parenting,child iphone,6egdhk,How do I teach my stepdaughter how to recognize emotional manipulation without manipulating her myself?,"Hey Folks.. first off, thank you for the years of sage wisdom.
I have three step kids, the eldest is my daughter, Erica, who is 10 years. Erica is the only child that has any memories of living with her BD and as a result carries an enormous amount of guilt and longing for a lost life with him. She does see him every other weekend but naturally she longs for more interaction to the point she cries at night if he misses a weekend, or doesn't call her after saying he will.

My concern in general is that her BD is a very manipulative person and often tries to use Erica's feelings as leverage and seems to feed into them as much as possible. He plays the victim for all of his hardships, blames me and his mother for their separation and has been quite vocal about it to the children which is incredibly unfortunate. BD believes we are the worst sort of people and makes little effort to hid his opinion of us to the children.

When Erica was 7 he bought her an iphone for Christmas, demanding we get her online so she can message and call him anytime she wanted to. This was done without consultation with Mom or myself, who limit the children's exposure to the internet. I've been online. I know whats out there. We declined granting Erica internet access as we felt she was to young to be online unsupervised, and to be honest, we did not want BD being able to reach out and manipulate Erica at his will. To be clear we have never restricted contact between Erica and her BD, he has always been able to call her, or Erica call him.
Here is the issue at hand.

As Erica is entering Grade 6 next year, she has campaigned hard for a phone. She will be busing to school across town and cites that she needs a phone for emergencies, and that phones are commonplace among her peer group. I'm actually quite proud of the arguments she has made, but I digress. Erica also cited that she would like a phone in order to be able to communicate with her BD more regularly, to be able to imessage and facetime with him. This in turn opens the gateway for positive interactions with her father, but at the same time, opens the door for manipulation. So I am faced with this unavoidable evolution in her social life and I want to prepare her for it.

**How do I teach my daughter how to recognize emotional manipulation without manipulating her myself by forcing my world view, or projecting my concerns about her father onto her?**


What do I do here? I try to teach critical thinking, evidence vs rumor, the scientific method, but I don't know how to prepare her for the social puppetry that is emotional manipulation.
Please, help or advice if you have any to offer."
Parenting,child iphone,1wjzkw,6 yo w/ severe sleep issues,"First I warn you this is a long post.

Im a 21 yo dad with a 6 yo daughter in kindergarden. Her mother is currently in psychiatric ward. Both her mother and I have had sleep issues pretty much all of our lives, but they didnt escalate until our teens (in fact we met in child psych, although sleep issues werent the main reason we were there). My daughter has now started experiencing sleep issues similar to ours. She has to be in bed by 8 PM every night and we will read until no later than 8:30. After that: lights out. Every morning I wake her up at 6:45 AM by turning on the lights and music. By 7 AM she needs to be out of bed.

As a single parent (for now) I work until 5 PM, but Ive arranged it so I can go to work earlier two days per week and pick her up at 3 PM, which means she doesnt have to stay that for that long at daycare at her young age every single day of the week (weve also arranged it so that she goes home with a friend at 3 PM a third day of the week). However, this also means that I need to leave home earlier. Those days I prepare breakfast and wake her up right when I leave and she gets dressed, eats and walks to kindergarden by herself (it is a close walk, no traffic). 

Recently, with the sleep issues, it's been harder and harder to get her out of bed in the mornings. Ive tried putting her to bed at 7 PM instead of 8 PM for a consistent 6 weeks, but that didnt help at all, so were back to 8 PM with reading until 8:30. Shes not allowed to turn on the lights or use her Iphone or watch TV or do any activity after that. I check on her to make sure shes not. I know she does try to sleep because sometimes when I check on her Ill find her crying and Ill ask her whats wrong and she says she cant sleep and she knows how tired she will be in the morning and thats why shes crying. I have also found her reading with a flashlight under her blanket and she told me its because she got so bored after trying to sleep for hours (it was 2 AM by then). 

In the mornings she is extremely tired and after I wake her up she falls back to sleep within 30 seconds even though I turn on the lights and open the windows and turn on music. Its gone so far that this morning she told me to let her sleep longer and go to work and shell go to kindergarden by herself when she is not so tired, just like she does the days that I need to go to work early.

The doctors find nothing wrong with her and says they can prescribe sleep medication. I dont want to give her sleep medication at this age unless there is aboslutely no other way to make her sleep, but there is. Weekends she sleeps just fine until 10 AM (yes, Ive tried not letting her sleep so long weekends and that didnt help with weekdays either). I believe sleep is crucial to a childs development and I can tell she isnt getting enough. She gets tired and wants to take naps and is not as excited about activities as she used to be after kindergarden. This is why Im considering actually letting her sleep in to 10 AM and walk to kindergarden by herself. Shell still spend enough hours at kindergarden to develop socially and shell get the sleep she needs. Its not ideal having her get ready by herself every morning, but I think a lack of sleep is worse.

That might be a temporary solution (what do you think about it?), but this fall she starts school and then she will need to be in class by 8 AM. Im worried that if I let her sleep in now her body will get used to it and it will be even harder getting her to school this fall, but it seems like her body is set on sleeping late regardless. Ive tried hot milk before going to sleep, have tried bathes before sleep, have tried getting her exhausted by doing sports (she does skateboarding, gymnastics and plays soccer) and have talked to her to find out if there are any monsters or similar preventing her from sleeping (and there arent).  

So, Im asking you all if youve experienced similar and have any advice on how I can help her sleep at night. Would be very appreciated. "
Parenting,child iphone,2m2bsl,[Help] Can't decide on small and convenient camera for active child.,"Hey all,

----------------

TL;DR

Looking for advice on a reasonable priced camera that fits in a pocket to take photos of active child in non ideal lighting.

----------------

I have finally gotten tired of trying to use my iPhone as my on-the-go, pocket point and shooter. Between the blurry photos and bad low(er) lighting problems I am ready to look into getting something better.

I would love the advice from you on what kind of camera you have had good experiences with for photographing your kids (that don't always stand still in bright areas).

First, I have a D80 SLR which I still really enjoy. But this isn't convenient when the kid is doing something I want to photograph and the camera is in the other room or if we are out and about. Just looking for something small and super convenient.

I am looking for something that I can whip out of my pocket at a moments notice and take superior photos compared with an iPhone.

After multiple days of research I found these:

* [Canon S100](http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/canons100)
* [Panasonic Lumix LF1](http://www.dpreview.com/products/panasonic/compacts/panasonic_dmclf1)
* [Olympus XZ2](http://www.dpreview.com/products/olympus/compacts/oly_xz2)

If anyone knows about these cameras or has **ANY** suggestions about other cameras in the €300ish range that have been shown to work well with kids on the fly... I would really appreciate it.

PS. I am not opposed to spending more (maybe) but would love an explanation/advice why it would be worth it for what I need it for. "
Parenting,child iphone,2eufp2,"Difficult parenting situation, 11 year old, 4.5 year old mornings and getting ready for school.","In the past year we have done 2 interstate moves and a few job changes, including sudden unemployment for my husband (the primary breadwinner). It was a highly stressful situation. Starting 6 weeks ago, we are now both employed full time and living all under one roof, so things should be great... right? 


Our younger kid (4.5) just started preschool in the same private school where the older kid is in middle school. The school has before/after care so we have optimized the logistics of child care. The school is about 2 miles from our rental house, so a nice short drive.


Our older kid has adhd and anxiety disorder - medicated for both. He had had some difficulty with the disruptions of moving twice, unemployment, etc etc. There is an especially huge problem of how he and my husband interact with one another. Basically, when husband gets stressed about the kids he micromanages EVERYTHING. long sleeves vs short. shorts vs. pants, which shoes to wear, how much dinner to eat, etc etc. We have a picture from a 2nd grade field trip where our kid is wearing long sleeves with extra sweatshirt tied around his waste, and the other kids are all wearing only t-shirts. There have been many situations where kid asks me what to wear, I give a suggestion, and he goes downstairs and ordered by husband to wear the opposite. (husband in these cases was not aware that my opinion had been asked.) 

My husband does not take parenting advice from me, but he is responsive sometimes to PhD psychologists. However, he also has the knack for saying exactly what they want to hear (years of working in marketing). He had a past psychologist convinced everything was fixed, and counseling could end, when the issues  were not fixed. (due to scheduling at that time, my husband was taking the bid kid to appointments) I came in for a weekend appointment, explained the issues, and counseling continued.

The marriage has been really badly stressed by our parenting differences, though we are very closely aligned in other ways. I have considered divorce over the interactions before, though husband has softened in specific areas. (he no longer threatens to burn toys if a kid misbehaves.) We did marriage counseling (now ended) and it made me feel a little better, and my husband feel worse.

The current issues:
1) How to get the kids to school at 8:30 am. The big kid needs to be physically dragged out of bed in the morning - he won't wake up for alarms, lights, patting, etc. I have to pull him out of bed and stand him up, then he gets annoyed and walks to the bathroom. It was ""my turn"" this morning and there were bottlenecks with a) big kid putting all the computer things in his bag b) little kid not willing to put his shoes on in order to eat in the car c) little kid complaining about how his waffle was prepared. I offered a prize if everyone was in the car on time, and they were both in the car by 8:32am. (12 minutes after the scheduled time to leave). When I told the younger kid there would be no prize, he bawled for the rest of the car ride. :-(
2) How to get the older kid to do his checklist items in the evening. On the advice of a psychologist, he has a checklist instead of parents nagging constantly. We just remind him to look at checklist. This seems to have very little traction. (by 7pm or so, his ADHD meds have pretty much entirely worn off.) If I say something to him, it is pretty much ignored. If my husband does, there is an overly dramatic response. There is a line on the evening checklist for ""pack backpack"" but it did not get done yesterday. By 8:45pm the big kid was dragging and babbling random things and pretending to fall asleep on the floor instead of actually going to bad. When I asked him to go to bed, there was no response, just more babbling about a specific color. 
3) My husband (more organized than me, much less empathetic) has no problem with mornings - just march them through the steps. I have difficulty just getting myself put together and out the door on time. 
4) What kind of incentives can actually work for an 11 year old? Money is not very important to him. He likes pokemon cards and minecraft, but the thrill of new pokemon cards is very very brief compared to the cost. And he is very picky, so cards bought on the used market are not very interesting to him. Anyone know of an iphone app to manage kids screen time? He would be interested in 5 minute increments of screen time, if there was an App for that. 

TLDR; yo, parenting is tough. "
Parenting,child iphone,6b0xl1,Cell phone for 12 & 9 yo.,"My daughters currently have my old iphone 5s as their cell phone. They have to share the phone. Recently it's been becoming more and more of an issue for them having to share it.

The first reason is that our daughters do activities at night. They get dropped off and sometimes the end time is different than what was scheduled, so when this happens if the kid that got dropped off doesn't have the phone they have to borrow someone else's. Not a huge deal, but it does make me anxious that they can't get ahold of me if needed.

The second reason is that my 9-year-old does not respect my 12-year-olds privacy. My oldest has made some friends that are not friends with the youngest. They are nice to her, but they aren't her friends. So when my older daughters friends are texting her the younger one will constantly ask ""what's she saying"" or she will ask for the phone and read the conversations. We've discussed this with her, but yet there seems to be a struggle still. It's difficult for me to enforce privacy boundaries on a phone they share together. I'm afraid of the older kid deleting messages or using apps like snapchat to have more private conversations that she doesn't want her sister to read. 

So this led us to have a conversation about getting the younger one her own cell phone. The main purpose would be so that they both have the ability to contact us when they are at rehearsals and activities, but it also seems to solve the privacy issue as well. 

My question or query is, how does everyone else handle cell phones with their children. They both want new iphones, but I think that much on a phone for a child is ridiculous. We were thinking maybe iphone SEs but don't want to waste our money, ya know? Any other options or ideas? "
Parenting,child iphone,6p939j,Advice on baby monitors,"Any of you guys have something that ticks these boxes?

Parenting,child iphone,3av72k,Cell phones for kids,"I'd like to get a cell phone for my tech savvy young son, who is almost 5. He can handle an iPhone easily, but I'd prefer something without Internet access that can only call family members like mom, dad, and grandparents. Ideally cheaper, smaller (child pocket sized?), and more durable than an iPhone too.

He can't read yet so we don't need texting. I just want to be able to duct tape this sucker to his forehead so it's always with him (kidding) (mostly) and so I can call him at any time, and vice versa.

I remember seeing a phone at Walmart a long time ago that only had buttons for calling mom and dad, but this must have been a decade past now. I can't imagine they still make those. But something like that would be great. 

Any suggestions?

ETA: I'm aware he's quite young for a cell phone. I'm just asking for recommendations for kid-friendly devices and not looking to start a debate. Our family is big on travel, and it'd be helpful to have a way to keep in touch while separated. I promise I'm not dumping my child in random places unattended. ;)"
Parenting,child iphone,1z5w0e,The damned Apple tablets with no time limit restrictions on gaming,"It is my opinion that Apple is deliberately not giving us sufficient parental controls.

<rant>
I imagine that Apple is blocking the root level access needed for these programs to succeed with the features we all want. The fact that I can add parental controls to a 2001 operating system (windows xp) with time limits and other restrictions but I cannot with a 2014 handheld device is unacceptable for my view on Apple in this area. 

I respect Apple limits/blocks adult oriented apps in their app store. That shows they are pro kids in one aspect but not pro parent in the area of parental time limits. It would be nice to have granular parental controls such as number of texts allowed out per day, number of hours on specific category apps (ex: 2 hours education apps: 1 hour gaming), times of day phone can access wifi. 

Yes you can control your router in this aspect but in a lot of areas (such as apartments) kids can just access another router. The device should have admin and user based access like the mac and pc os does, my kid should not be able to connect to an insecure wifi signal without my consent of entering a passcode. If they connect to another wifi signal they are than off my parental controls built in the router and off my time limits built in the router. 

Apple is going to have to expand their parental controls is the bottom-line. I also thought for 4 to 8 year olds, making it so that mom and dad are the only ones allowed to charge it and there being an app that would allow a certain percentage of battery, say 30%. This for iPod and no service iPhone users are a way to manage time limits. If your kids did their chores they would get 60% battery and again the family rule would be no one but mom and dad has the right to plug in the device for power. Once the battery drained the device was set put on charger by Mom and Dad and programmed with the battery level for the next day. The fact that these devices have 10 hour battery life contributes to the problem. 

I just think Apple could make it easier for parents than having to track it other ways. I would also love if Apple had usage statistics, where a parent can review what apps and number of hours the kid was in for a duration say 7 days. If the child was in primarily education apps the parental controls may not be as necessary as for a child that is hooked on one game.

My children know our rule that is they must create on the iPad/iPhone equal to the amount they play/watch on it. Therefore yes I can monitor as I pass by them if they are in games/video apps more than half my checking than something is wrong. My daughter is on the iPad 6 hours on the weekend and most of that is creating movies in iMovie. Why would I want to stop that, again some usage statistics would be nice so parents at a minimum could at least go back and see amount of time a child was in an app. This type of feature is available for PCs and macs using spectorpro software, it monitors what the user is working on in, not the background windows. iOS is a fairly mature product and really needs to catch up to PC and Mac for parental controls, usage reports, time restrictions, etc.

Parenting,child iphone,3l9ivl,My (33f) little sister (16f) wants to move in with me because the law allows it in my country,"Hello Reddit! I usually do not speak english, but i will try my best. I posted this in relationships,  but I would love parents' s perspective too.


I am a teacher and I am becoming a lawyer next year. I am 33f and single. I live in a third world country. I come from a very good and large family. I live alone, near my parents house.


My parents got married very young and have four children:me, my two brothers (29m and 31m) and my little sister (16 f).They have children in their 20s and 40s. 


I have always have an amazing relationship with my sister. I took care of her many times, like all of us. She is the person that i love the most. I do not love my brothers like her. 


My parents are excelent. They raised four children very well, in a tradicional kind of family.They work hard, own a house, my dad gives us everything, always helped us. My mom is like a 1950 mom that cooks, clean, listens, take care of everything. 


My parents are great, but they do not really get along with my sister. She is very mature and wants freedom. My parents are strict, in the sense that they do not let her go out with people they do not know, on a school night, they have to aprove who she dates. On the other hand, they spoiled her and she goes to a great school, has an iphone, and amazing clothes. 


My sister is very beautiful (model kind of beautiful) so she always have men and boys chasing after her. My brothers and father are constantly monitoring her.


The problem: The law changes this year, allowing 16 years old to live with a family member they want. My sister just turns 16 and wants to move in with me. She is still in high school.


My sister wants to move in with me to be an adult. She told me that. There is no other reason. I am moving an hour away for a job and she wants to join me, because legally my parents have to pay me child support.


I never took care of anybody. I barely cook, I work all day, my flat is going to be tiny, an hour away from her life and I am poor. But I would totally move in with her, because i love her like a daughter. But she is not my daughter.


My family blew up. My mom is pissed, told me I want to take her daughter away. My brother found out, got angry and left in 10 minutes. When my father finds out, I do not know how badly he takes it.


I told my sister to stay home, because I cannot provide the amazing life or guidance my parents can. My sister got sad. Everybody hates me in the family now, and they are angry at my sister. My mother was always jealous that her daughter gets along better with me and now is full of anger.


This was all my sisters idea, but I did not tell her no right away. She keeps insisting, even i told her no today.


Deepdown, I would move in with her because I raised her too. But I am not her mom and I know it would be wrong. My life is a mess and I have not much to offer to a child. I do understand she is tired of having sooo many adults trying to control her, since she has like five parents counting her adult siblings place extended family ( she is the kid of an ""old"" family).


How do I fix it?


*** TL;DR: **** My (33f) little sis (16f) wants to move in with me, an hour away and the family is really angry.


Update: my sister is staying with my parents. They are not that mad at me. My sister spent two hours watching  a show with me and seems ok with everything. Mom told me my sister is gonna miss me because I am moving an hour away and that is why she wanted to go too, besides her freedom. Besides that, my sis is angry at the family because she wants to go to parties at school night and my parents do let her best friend stay here. Her best friend is a 15 old girl that is dating my sister's ex boyfriend (and made my sis cried). Load of teen drama."
Parenting,child iphone,3chqor,App Idea: Wheel of Discipline,"iPhone app idea for parents: The spinning wheel of discipline. 

For the last year we have been using the lessons of 1-2-3 Magic to instill better behavior in Isaac. At first transgression he gets counted: ""1"". For a second infraction: ""2"". And finally at the third transgression: ""3"" and a 5-minute timeout. In theory you are giving your child an opportunity to regulate their own behavior.

Isaac is not a fool. Basically we have trained him to be an pain in the butt until he gets to ""2"" at which point he tones it down... Or decides that the transgression is worth accepting a 5-minute timeout.

We all remember that with rewards, unpredictability spurs relentless behavior. People will sit at a slot machine because they never know if the next pull will yield a Jackpot. I propose that similarly, unpredictability can inhibit bad behavior... Hence the wheel of punishment.

At first transgression you open the app and spin the wheel. Around and around it goes and where it stops determines the punishment. 2/3 chance of a warning. 1/3 chance of any punishment. Punishments range from timeout (75% chance), double timeout (15% chance), no TV for a day (7.5% chance), no TV or iPad/iPhone for a week (2% chance), favorite toy donated to charity (0.4% chance), mommy and daddy go away for the weekend and leave the kids with their least favorite babysitter (0.1% chance).  

Even the most mild infraction could bring the harshest of penalties (percentages and punishments are user customizable). 

What does Reddit think? Would it work on your kid? 

I was inspired when I realized how much satisfaction it gave us after dealing with outlandish behavior to then watch our child scream in protest when we took away something he really wanted. Seeing as we don't believe in hitting our children it would be really nice to have an App to help us inflict arbitrary and meaningful punishments in a capricious way. Sure, go ahead and fight... Just know there's a 1 in 3,000 chance that mom and dad are jetting out of town for the weekend without you.

Any developer friends with kids want to get in on the ground floor on the Wheel of Discipline®

BTW: I chose 1 in 3,000 as the chance a misdeed results in a child-free mommy-daddy weekend because I can't afford to go away more than once a month."
Parenting,child iphone,2drbnn,Tried to take DS6-ADHD to a festival today. How could I have handled this better? [long],"My husband and I tried to meet my best girlfriend and her family at a Ren Faire with our family today. We have three kids. DD16, DS4, and DS6-ADHD.  It didn't go well, and I am trying to figure out how we could have done better.  

**About the situation:**  My son is primarily hyperactive type and usually on medication, which (together with behavioral techniques) generally manages the disorder fairly well, though certainly not perfectly.  As it is a summer weekend, he is currently on a medication holiday.  He suffers some boomerang symptoms (regular symptoms of his ADHD, but somewhat magnified) as he goes through ""withdrawal"" from the medication - this is day 3 off.  He seemed okay this morning and usually LOVES the faire.  

However, we had a bit of a toxic brew going on today. I understand that he was cooped up in the car for two hours+ (double the time of the normal trip), that he was tremendously excited to see two of his best friends, and that the faire is both exciting and potentially overstimulating.  I know that this set of circumstances can be a recipe for disaster. 

**What happened and how we handled it** - We realized upon arrival at the faire that he was feeling a little off.  As such, we decided to ""divide and conquer:""  My husband took responsibility for our little one and the wagon and I was on boy duty.  Our first stop was the food court to get food (though he had eaten well before we left, everyone else was hungry too!) He ate wonderfully once we got the food - both his own lunch and his brother's as well! Usually, we find that food will calm him down some, and had hoped that it would work its magic this time. Not quite.  

I had a very difficult time corralling him. He wanted to run off constantly to explore on his own - but the faire was very crowded and for a boy with very little impulse control, full of temptations.  I acted as his shadow and tried to redirect him back to the group, and attempted to keep a hand on him the entire time so that he didn't inadvertently run into other fairgoers.  Of course, I kept up a steady stream of verbal warnings and apologies to other people as well. He wasn't running AWAY from me, or being defiant, he just seemed completely unable to contain himself.  (""OOooh! Mommy! Look at THAT.........!"")

He was particularly interested in the decorative water features (fountains, ponds, wishing wells) and seemed absolutely drawn to them. When it became clear that he couldn't just hang out on the grass with the other kids, I first tried to get him to wheelbarrow walk - hoping that the ""heavy work"" would allow him to feel more centered, but it was a no go. I told him that if he could stay nearby - without being disruptive to other people or things - during lunch, I would reward him with a penny to toss into the well.  I gave him three chances and he did in fact earn the penny.  

After lunch, we dithered some about where to go and ultimately decided on seeing a knife throwing show.  My son was very excited about it, and was eager to get close to see. He absolutely would not stay with either myself or his dad, claiming each time that he couldn't see well. We had to prevent him from running to the front of the stage three times. Finally, as having a young child running about near where people are throwing KNIVES at each other is probably a little unsafe, we removed him from the show.  

He was certainly disappointed, but what he really, really wanted to do was lay on his stomach on the foot bridge outside the amphitheater and watch the fish in the stream, occasionally spitting into the water.  I permitted him to do this. (I figured spitting into the water is better than anywhere else, and that as long as he kept his feet curled up I could pretty much make sure he wasn't in anyone's way. I am not sure that this was a considerate decision on my part.) He laid there happily for the remaining half hour of the show.    

We rejoined our good friends and started toward a more kid-friendly magic show. On the way there, we stopped so our kids could do some of the carnival-style games, including one of those hammer strength test things. My boy was thrilled. We allowed him to do all of the games at least twice a piece. But, his desire to run off to explore, climb boulders, dabble in water features, pick up rocks, and now spit on things (rocks, the ground) persisted.  I assured him that we would see everything he wanted to see, and that he didn't have to run off to see them - we would certainly get to them eventually! I explained to him the plan of action (first we will go to this thing, then that thing, then this other thing). Usually this helps, but the above behaviors persisted. I allowed him to climb on boulders when I could (but again I am not sure of the wisdom/appropriateness of this action), but we ultimately decided to separate from our friends and meet up with them again later.  

I gave him a stick of bubble gum, in the hopes that chewing it would fulfill the same need as spitting, and happily this seemed to work very well! I put him on my lap, and we were able to watch a short juggling show.  Afterwards, we made our way towards the joust (he LOVES the joust). Because of the conflicting desires of his siblings, the necessity of pulling the wagon, and the crowds, this took a very long time.  I ran after him and reminded him to be mindful of other people and their personal space. I also repeated his usual ""stop, think, have a plan"" mantra.  I told him (as I always do) that if he tells me what his plan is, I can usually help him to achieve it.  It seemed like he was bursting out of his very skin.  I arranged to meet my family down the road a bit and accompanied him on his explorations.  He found a storm drain, crouched down on top and spent 15 minutes quietly dropping pebbles into it.  Unfortunately, a sweet and friendly performer unwittingly scared him off, and we met up with our family again and went to see people hitting each other with lances and swords.    

Usually, this is right up his alley. Unfortunately, he couldn't see very well again, and we had to restrain him from muscling his way to the front. Even though he was careful to say ""excuse me"" and ""sorry"" to other viewers, and even though HE could fit in the spaces he wanted to sit in, I could not permit him to do so because *I* couldn't fit beside or behind him. And, I was too nervous that he might run out into the field in a fit of enthusiasm and be trampled beneath the hooves of a horse (I know that sounds unlikely. It isn't. At the knife show, he was trying to get onto the stage.) or get too up into the personal space of a stranger.  Ultimately, he got bored and, though we tried to extend the time the rest of the family could enjoy the show by giving him the iPhone to play with, we left the joust when he began to act out (I am also unsure of this action. He cannot remain places where he is behaving inappropriately, but isn't removing him when he gets bored - even though I KNOW he has a shorter attention span than other children his age - merely giving him what he wants?)   

We began to walk again, to explore shops, etc. but my  boy just would't/couldn't restrain himself. He isn't really defiant (though of course he is sometimes!) - it was like that song in The Sound of Music: ""How do you solve a problem like Maria?/How do you make her stay/and listen to what you say/How do you pin a wave upon the sand?"" My husband and I were both fairly exhausted and frustrated at this point, and we decided to pull the plug and go home. Our plan was to have everyone use the bathroom, have one last treat, and then leave. Again, we divided and conquered: my husband got the goodies, our daughter minded the youngest one, and I minded our little Dennis the Menace.  I had him roll down the hill near the exit repeatedly as we waited.  I am also unsure of these two actions. Should I have allowed him the final treat? Everyone else in the family was getting one. Would it have been cruel to deny him? I figured leaving early was enough of a consequence. Was it okay to let him roll down a hill?  I hoped that it would be helpful to him.   

The children had to walk nicely (the long way) to the car before they were allowed their treat, and my daughter kindly ran all the way down the hill with our boy all the way to the lot.  On the ride home, both his siblings fell asleep, but he did not.  He sat in the middle, awake the whole time, and was actually quiet, conversative and content until the last 10 minutes of the ride, when I allowed him to use my phone again.   

**What did we do wrong? How could I have made this work? What should we have done differently?  Should we have given him the medication after all? Should we have left the wagon so we were more mobile? Should we have aborted after the traffic or when we saw the size of the crowds?  How would you have handled this situation? Help!!**  

Thanks in advance, everyone. I might crosspost this to /r/ADHD. In the meantime, my husband and I are going to split a very large bottle of wine.  "
Parenting,child iphone,2dbwpz,Apps for children.What makes them useful?,"There are many apps for children and young adults to use. Based on these article I discovered some of the most popular ones for 2013: http://www.theguardian.com/technology/appsblog/2013/jun/19/50-best-apps-kids-iphone-android-ipad

Since I am also working for a startup specializing in educational technology I was wondering about the types of apps you are using in your  daily effort to enhance your children's skills and knowledge. 

Our tool (you can check it out on https://www.sharplet.com/) is mainly aimed towards children and adults interested in learning and revising, so it can be useful for learning a foreign language, history, geography etc.

Do you think there are other topics that might be of an interest to a child or young adult? Should the content be interactive or based on a video? I would love your thoughts. Thank you!"
Parenting,child iphone,1h20gp,Would parents be interested in a new way to teach their kids about money?,"[Piggy bank and iPhone app for kids](http://imgur.com/a/F0rYe)

I had this idea and think it would be pretty cool. Does r/Parenting think its worth pursuing?

When I was a kid my parents taught me how to write a check and balance a checkbook. Do you think your kids will need to know about this? No, financial management has changed and we need new tools to teach our children how to manage their money. What about taking the iconic piggy bank and giving it an upgrade. 
This piggy bank can be accessed from an app on your iPhone or iPad. There is a parent (bank) version and a child version of the app. The parent can ""deposit"" and withdraw money into the child's account. Cash can also be added and the child will automatically see the balance increase on the app. Just like making a deposit at your own bank and then checking the balance online."
Parenting,video games,101up41,"Son addicted to video games, unsure how to approach without making it worse","I have a son aged 13 who is quite literally addicted to video games. 

3 years ago we bought him a secondhand xbox for his 10th birthday, and he would play it for a couple of hours on the weekends, nothing excessive, and we talked to him about online safety and taking breaks from screen time regularly before we gave it to him.

Over the past 2 months he's suddenly been glued to the xbox. As soon as he gets home from school he'll play the xbox until he goes to bed. All he does on the weekends is play his xbox. 

His grades and sleeping patterns are still normal. But his personal hygiene is, well, bad. He needs to be constantly asked to take a shower and has only been showering once a week. He also refuses to stop playing his xbox to do mundane things like eat dinner and loses his temper when asked.

I've talked to my son about it and tried to get him to open up about his feelings. He's quite literally obsessed with the xbox and talking to him is like talking to a wall these days.

My husband said we need to take away his xbox or restrict his time on it with parental controls until he can use it responsibly but I worry that this may make him obsess over it more and make it worse. My husband said I'm coddling him.

I don't know what the right course of action is."
Parenting,video games,10oqa9z,I’d like to hear from parents who’ve decided to take away video games for good,"2nd and 4th grader. We have a Nintendo Switch, and we set time limits to 1:30hr per kid, per day.  We extend time sometimes, when they ask.  But, I’ve noticed this past week (parent transfer conference week / half days, fewer activities / more play time allowed by me) worst behavior.  Seems like withdrawals.  

I’ve taken it away for as long as a week now for misbehavior.  They usually act better.  I’m thinking of just pulling the plug for a while.  

I monitor what they play.  They’re quality games.  But, I’m concerned about how they act afterwards, once play stops.  Or how they act when they don’t get their fix. 

Just looking for first-hand accounts of parents who’ve been through this.  Not interested in opinions of non-parents, or parents who haven’t ever had video games in the house.  Thanks.


Edit: for those saying 1.5hr is too much, what times do you allow?  Seems to me that non-trivial games take that long to get into.  Btw, I add time if it’s Ringfit (aerobics game) or a dance game.  How do you change time limits for those?  FYI: we live in a climate that gets typically inhospitable for outside play during the winter months, for context."

Parenting,video games,109jxj6,My eight year old has zero interests outside of video games and YouTube,"It’s a bit of an exaggeration, but it’s really difficult to get him to do any other activity. He does enjoy soccer which he plays in spring and fall. There’s an upcoming soccer clinic for 10 weeks that his mom and I want him to do but he is protesting and does not want to do it.

He did it last session and getting him to go every morning on a Saturday is anxiety inducing and  I felt awful for forcing him to go (his mom and I don’t agree on parenting styles and she will yell at him until he goes). 

I feel conflicted because it is useful for him and healthy for obvious reasons but I also feel bad that he basically gets no choice in it.

His mom has tried giving him options for activities (martial arts, gymnastics, basketball..) and all are no.

He’s simply a homebody. Which I don’t necessarily view as a bad thing I just want him to but healthy and fit. He is a couch potato and his mom is no help because she’s never instilled the importance of the good kind of  diet and is very liberal with junk food and sweets (honestly it almost seems like she is this way because SHE wants to eat the bad stuff and is convenient for her). She is also pretty sedentary while I’m active person and go to the gym at least five days a week.

We want him to get evaluated for ADHD as we suspect he has it but we have not gotten around to that due to long waitlists.

Parenting,video games,yvnk00,How do I talk to my husband about his video games habits?,"I (25f) have a 3 month old baby with my (28m) husband. During my pregnancy, I was lenient about my husband playing games because I had a preconceived notion that once the baby was here, he wouldn’t have that much time. 
My husband works from home. Majority of the time he’s playing games on his phone, if not he’s watching video game related videos (and sometimes both). After work, he still plays games and after dinner (8pm) he’ll help with bathtime and then he goes to play video games until midnight. In a typical day, he’ll only spend time with our baby if I need to eat or run an errand and can’t take the baby with me (usually an hour or so errand because I breastfeed). So if I’m not running an errand, he’ll have our baby for 30min or an hour at most. I love him and absolutely adore him as my partner. As a father, I wish he would do more. He told me that he hates this stage because he can’t do much with our son, that he’s waiting until he walks. This is a similar conversation we had when I was pregnant. That he was going to wait until the baby got here to speak to him and interact with him. He doesn’t even know how to put our son to sleep or calm him down. How do I bring this up to him without hurting his feelings?
He’s a great husband to me. He makes time for me and allows me to have time for myself anytime I need it. He’s allowed me to stay home for our baby without making me feel guilty or stressed about it. I just want him to spend more time with our son without playing games and actually bond with him."

I have a toddler in the house so I usually go to sleep around 9, but last night she stayed the night with grandma. So I was up later than usual and that's how I heard it.

My husband is frustrated as well. I tried to tell him to just get rid of the Xbox as she has proven to not be able to follow the rules with this or ANY other electronic thing she gets. She's 10, I don't think she needs an Xbox in her room anyways. Thoughts on this? In the past we have taken them away for a week and given them back. That doesn't work as a deterrent either.

From day one it has been an unmitigated disaster. Our usually very placid chilled-out little boy turns into a demon EVERY time we let him have gaming time on the Nintendo. We have only ever let him play on it for 30 minutes at a time and we structure this by setting an alarm on one of our phones.

The sheer level of aggression we get for about 3 hours after it goes away is astonishing. Smacking, kicking, screaming, throwing things and being awful to his little sister. (all of which are massively out of character for him!)

Parenting,video games,vap9op,Stepson (8) is addicted to video games,"Greetings fellow parents,

My wife and I have children from our previous marriages. My wife has an 8-year old boy, and he's shared 50/50.

The kid is a good person, respectful, does great in school, excels in martial arts (goes 4 times a week), and has outstanding communication skills.

What concerns me is he's addicted to video games, to the point that he'd rather stay home instead of going go-karting, golfing, bike-riding, and even traveling.

I remember once we were in Disney and he said he wanted to go to the hotel to play.

He's also unable to control his emotions, and whenever something doesn't go as he'd expect in the video game, he starts yelling and crying, and throwing a tantrum.

He always treats his mom with respect, except for the times when she tells him to stop playing video games.

My question is: what can we do to help him? How can we set the frame that it's unacceptable to give up on many other age-appropriate activities so that he can play games?

In the words of my wife, she's afraid to forbid the games because of his inability to control his emotions relating to video games.

Thanks a lot."

My kids have been sick all weekend, as have I. Fever, chest congestion, headache, fatigue ect. We all have covid tests this afternoon but the kids still have to be fever free for 24 hours without Tylenol and a negative covid test before returning to school. They napped a lot this weekend but while resting my son played on his switch and my little one watched tv when not sleeping. Same deal today. However my husband who I’m pretty sure is the one who got us sick- and Is now on antibiotics feeling better- keeps saying if they’re well enough to watch tv/play video games they should have went to school. But no. They haven’t been fever free even with Tylenol and they now have to have a covid test to return to school. And the only tests I could schedule were PCR tests which take 24-48hrs to come back. (We live in a rural area and their ped office and my GP is over an hour away) so we just use the drive through at our local pharmacy that does them. However, we have all been vaccinated except for my daughter as she’s too young. I had COVID back in March of 2020 and it felt totally different. We can all still smell and taste. This feels more like the flu or the beginning stages of pneumonia. Which aren’t much better but I’m sick of trying to fight with this man when I feel like shit. And if I’m down and out- I’m really sick. My kids symptoms seem to be the same as mine and I feel bad because the headache that comes with whatever we have is like someone putting your head into a Vice and all the pressure on the sides and front really hurt. As I wrote this the kids finished a couple quarters of toast and passed out in their beds. But I don’t want to fight about video games/tv when it’s obviously distracting them so they’re not focusing on how they feel. I mean Jesus we are in bed ourselves watching tv so it feels hypocritical. My daughter has 101.8 temp. My son was 102.1 and I’m 102.6. So it’s not like they’re “faking” being sick and I would never send a child to school with even a low grade fever. Especially with flu season and covid. Our state is #1 for new cases per capita in the entire country so I’d rather be cautious than careless. I just don’t wanna fight with him on this when either way they wouldn’t be in school with a fever even if that was their only symptom. Am I wrong?


**********Update**********
So we all tested positive for covid. However it’s like day 5 of symptoms for myself and the kids and like day 3 for my husband. My children and I- our fevers all broke today. My chest is still heavy and congested but I don’t feel nearly as bad as yesterday. Just a slight headache. Hopefully symptoms peaked yesterday and the day before. And now on the mend. I can’t up my vit c intake Bc I’m pregnant. But I have upped everyone else’s vit c intake. As well as giving magnesium, zinc, and vit d supplement. I’m just taking my prenatals as normal. Have a telehealth appointment with my OB today, and my pulmonary doctor Bc of my asthma. I have a po2 monitor here, blood pressure cuff for an infant, one for a toddler, small child, small adult and regular adult and a stethoscope. Been checking everyone’s vitals every 4hrs to monitor vitals. My husband has a ton of pre existing conditions and is at the highest risk for this to be severe. I have my rn, BSN so I’m comfortable in keeping an eye on my family myself for the most part. I left work at the beginning of covid because once the children’s school closed i did not have child care Bc my husband has worked through the pandemic. Both of us weren’t able to work without childcare."

Parenting,video games,tcjo38,"I have the desire to spoil my kids (5yo / 7yo) with video games, when is it too much?","We are a gaming family. Both their mom and I play a lot of video games and thus this ended up with the kids also playing a lot of video games. Growing up my parents never understood video games and weren't really into buying us any. It also didn't help that we had a big family and were poor. As a child I would always see video games at the store wish I could get them only to be told no, next time or maybe for your birthday or Christmas.

Fast forward to today and I never want my kids to experience that. Thus I've bought them every console and game without them even having to ask. For context we have the newest XBOX, PS5, Nintendo Switch and both of them have their own computers. All of which they've never had to ask or beg me to buy.

Before it sounds like I'm bragging trust me I'm not. I am seriously questioning if the way I'm doing things is any better than how my parents raised me. I do however want to say that my children do not act spoiled. They seem very much grateful for what they have but I'm sure they don't understand they are lucky to have all these things.

In your experience, is spoiling your kids without them even knowing their spoiled a bad thing? Should I continue what I'm doing or should I reconsider how I'm giving them too much?

Thanks!"
Parenting,video games,t59ow6,Graduating 7yo from iPad to better video games?,"This might sound unusual, as I see plenty of posts about kids spending too much time on video games, but...   my son plays minecraft (and occasionally a few other simple puzzle games, mario run, etc) on ipad in the time that we allot him (after homework and anything else we want him to do is done).  He has asked in the past about getting a Switch, as he has friends with Switches.  We bypassed that this  past Christmas to his disappointment (he was 6 at the time), but he has largely forgotten, or at least not mentioned it recently.  I do feel a touch guilty that he plays games only on ipad, which I think the experience can't be as nice as holding a controller. Also I think it would be more social if he played on the TV, so that others could see and perhaps have 2-player games together.  But I'm not sure what to get, if anything.

He also has an almost 4yo little sister.  

Is Switch the best thing for younger kids (better than xbox or playstation?).  Are there other alternatives?  Something that wouldn't be terrible for his little sister too would be ideal.  I don't want to get them both addicted to gaming, but since we already manage their ipad time, I figure why not just switch (no pun intended) to something a little more enjoyable.  

Anybody been through this that has a recommendation for where to go?  Or just leave it alone?

I figure part of the strategy for choosing something for him is that he won't get to the point where he begs until I give in, then I might get him whatever he wants which might end up being something worse.  Better if I am in control of that decision to avoid going down the wrong path.

Also I considered maybe building a retro-pie thing with emulators like SNES.

Also Switch games seem very expensive!  Maybe the nintendo online subscription that gets you classic NES and SNES games would suffice?  Price for that seemed reasonable last I checked."
Parenting,video games,sgl2p7,How do you handle video games with mixed age servers?,"Hey all,

My 9 yo plays Minecraft and has started playing on a mixed age server that I haven't vetted yet. For those of you whose children are allowed to play video games on servers with other people, how do you keep your kids safe? (other than vetting the server, ofc) 

Our son is open about what he's done and with whom, he has had instruction in online privacy and we enforce screen time limits. 

What should I watch out for?

ETA: is this getting downvoted because it doesn't fit the sub or because people don't think I should be asking for advice?

I'm genuinely curious, how do you handle your child's/tween's access to the world of online games? I know I'm not the only one because my son's entire grade 4 class plays Roblox, so how do the rest of you deal with the dangers of online participation?"

Parenting,video games,rsylcu,Crying while playing video games,"My 6 year old has picked up on playing video games from his nephew over past couple of months. I didn’t stop it because it was essentially some racing games and he was having fun. Lately he has gotten into Rocket League which he enjoyed even more. However for past couple of weeks, he has become increasingly very frustrated with the game while playing, even to the point of crying as the game is going on. His reasons for crying are either he is losing the game or he is not the best scorer on his team that is winning. Sometimes he starts crying when his teammates bump into him and he misses out on scoring a goal. Crying doesn’t stop for like 20-30 minutes. He starts kicking and screaming when I tell him to tone it down. We have tried telling him to play a different game or a different format where you don’t play against online players but he is very adamant about what he plays and now spends lot of time crying over it. I just don’t see how this is beneficial on any level. We were going to surprise him with a new game but now we are thinking of stopping gaming completely. What do you all think?"

Parenting,video games,soykw3,Video games and bad behavior,"Both my sons love to play minecraft they are 10 and 6. Unfortunately when they play together they get very angry and start fighting. We turned it off today as my ten old had a rage. I hid the pads and he was grabbing me trying to get a key for the cupboard where they were stashed. They normally play on separate devices but join each other on line and try to kill each other. He starting slaming the door and gets very abusive. Its horrific as i cant imagine behaving like that at his age. Although i was sensitive to foods. We realised with certain icey poles would make him like this and sugar tends to contribute.

Sometimes it makes my ten year behave almost like a drug addict. Its really upsetting

Anyone else experience this?"
Parenting,video games,qkmtbv,Video Games - In-Game Purchases,"Just joined, so sorry if this is an old topic. In-game purchases in video games have caused many arguments in our home. Especially the ones that are announced as being available for one day (Fortnight!). Remember how there used to be advocacy groups that helped bring about the laws regarding truth in advertising to children, etc? Where the hell are they now? These companies use tactics to prey on children mercilessly. If I could snap my fingers and make all computer games disappear, I’d do it in a heartbeat!"

Parenting,video games,pqua8t,overly hyper with his body when playing video games,"My son is 6 years old, he is on the spectrum for autism but right on the line, he has been in therapy for speech and OT and he is doing great, he is also diagnosed with ADHD as they are often diagnosed together.  


When he is playing active video games (like Mario odyssey and Rayman legends) Iv noticed that he literally can not contain his body, when he jumps in game, he jumps in place sometimes multiple times. when he makes actions he mimics it with his physical body in some way. Sometimes he falls over, jumps, or runs in place. Iv tried talking to him about controlling his body but he seems like he can not at all.   


I don't know if this is an autism thing, an ADHD thing, or just a normal 6 year old thing.... he is fine with other games like Mario kart so i don't know..

Parenting,video games,pdhre3,Best video games to play with/against young kids?,"my child has never played video games and I'd like to introduce them to some games. I'm looking for games that we could play together, either co-op or vs, so they can appreciate games as a social enterprise.

I should note I don't play any video games, as I struggle with video game addiction, but don't think games are evil and don't think playing games with my kid would be bad. My choice to not play is a personal one, but I'd like my kid to experience games and be able to eventually make their own choices.

I also don't just want to download games and toss them at my kid... We have stricter screentime rules than most households and almost 100% of our kids screentime is family time (e.g., a movie on the weekend that we all watch together). I'd like games to follow this same pattern... A treat that we do together.

Any suggestions? I have an old android device that they could use and a computer connected to a projector via Chromecast. I'm also considering waiting till I could borrow an old system from my brother (I think he has a super Nintendo and a Nintendo 64 collecting dust in his basement)"
Parenting,video games,oci3ld,Video Games?,"This is an ongoing debate in my mom group and I want to see what people's opinions are. Our kids are still very young, so it isn't applicable yet, but it's still be a discussion recently. Do you allow your kids to play video games? If so, at what age did you introduce them?

Some of my friends are very anti video games and say no video games under any circumstances. I feel like as long as you make sure the content is age appropriate, like you would for a movie or to show, then a little gaming is harmless. I also feel that time limits for gaming are appropriate, and suggested to my husband that gaming be limited to the length of time you would spend watching an average movie, so no more than 1.5 or 2 hours per day. (I had a friend suggest this time limit was unrealistic, as 2 hours can pass like it's nothing when you're gaming.)

How has everyone else handled video games with kids?"
Parenting,video games,ms1blp,14Y old son rejects everything but video games and watching TV,"We're 2 weeks in the Easter break and our son has done virtually nothing apart from playing GTA online and watch TV. After a weeks on holiday we realized he was breaking the 4h screen time limit we set him by also playing at night. In parallel, he'd done none of the exams preparation he'd said he would do as condition of him getting this screen time allowance. Of course the holiday allowance is now gone and game console fully off limits. He doesn't get gaming allowance on school days and now no longer will on weekends. Wifi is restricted at night.

But I am worried about his attitude to everything else.

On homework, at best he pretends doing something by writing a few lines of vocabulary or sentences from revisions books but on discussing with him, it's clear he doesn't know what his notes are about. Any question about how much he plans to do gets him angry.

When asked about the reading list issued by his school, his answer was that he bought a book. it turned out to be a book recommended for children around 10 years old.

Outdoors sports (he plays Hockey) has restarted but he the news training was restarting got a shrug from him. None of everything he got to try with our without us (sailing/tennis/football/rugby/MTB) gets his vote and everything seems too much of an effort.

So it feels like he'll do anything (sleep deprivation, lying) for some screen time but has at best contempt about everything else.

Is this something that requires outside help ? Can other parents can relate to and have seen improving over time ? What seemed to help ?

Edit: to mention that allowance was removed and the restrictions we already have in place"

Parenting,video games,koznjx,Considering new study release on video games,"I myself am a early 30s parent of four. All of which are eight years old and younger. We’ve always lean towards gentle parenting and try to make choices that encourage kindness, compassion, and thoughtfulness. The most violent video games we allow our things like Minecraft, Zelda due to the level of fantasy, that’s pretty much it. Now my oldest who is in third grade comes home from school talking about the sheer amount of Fortnite and FPS games his peers play. He’s never been allowed to play them due to my feeling of, not violence and video games, but just the sheer age level and exposure to content.

I myself loved The GTA game series when it came out, played body harvest on 64 when it came out, and while I played video games with violent content and never developed psychotic tendencies, I just feel like there’s some thing offputting about it at these ages of 8 to 5 years old.

What are your thoughts? Am I letting anxiety cloud my judgment? Every post that I come across on violent video games are always preteenage. And every post I come across on children around seven years of age or about screen time limits and things like Minecraft.

I’ve considered exploring the route of opening up censorship and just maintaining consistent communication as well as consequences for anything that’s chosen to be expressed in an inappropriate way, but also their brains are still developing and sometimes they express things without clearly thinking them through. Which I think is unfair to punish someone for making a judgment call when they’re just literally not equipped to make.

Pardon any misspellings. Voice to text on a busy child morning!"
Parenting,video games,mriqvf,Video games,"Looking for advice. I can’t decide if I should be concerned or shouldn’t worry much about it. 

Son is 12 years old. Our jurisdiction has been in and out of lockdown since November, so seeing friends after school is technically illegal. He’s seen his friends a couple times when COVID case numbers were lower, but they’re much higher now, so it’s not happening. To make matters worse, he has spent probably half of the last calendar year out of school due to closures and is now on spring break and will be attending school virtually starting next week. 

During non-school hours, he spends most of his time playing video games - I’m talking like most hours of the day. He’ll stop to eat, and once approached to do chores, outdoor activity, and family time, he will quickly put his games away without any trouble, but left to his own devices, he would probably game all day. This is because he plays with all of his school friends.  They play in teams together so it allows him to connect with them. I don’t love the idea of video games to this level, but it’s the primary way he can connect and bond with his friends.

Should I be limiting this?  Just curious on everyone’s thoughts.

Edit: I should add, he doesn’t have any siblings, so no other children to play with at home."
Parenting,video games,6bokn3,"Parents with full time jobs, how many hours do you spend on video games/other hobbies?","I am positive my husband is addicted to video games. Yesterday he played from 4 to 10 pm. We have a 7 yr old and a 2 yr old. Last Friday, he had a day off. He didn't tell me about it. I thought he had gone to work, but then we heard him talking/yelling loudly at the tv in the back room. He played from 6am-330pm. Our 2 year old asked him to take a walk with us, he said he didn't want to. Sunday we went to the zoo. He was watching live gaming streams while we were walking around. 

He doesn't think he has a problem. I understand gaming is fun and an easy time-suck. I play 1-2 hours a week, but I am left with all of the parenting and housework, disclaimer, I am a stay at home mother. I don't want to say he can't play at all, I'm not his mother and I know his job is stressful and he uses it to relax. But I can't help but view it as him escaping from us.  When I ask for help I get told to get a job. What is a reasonable limit to ask him to adhere to? I've asked him to limit it to playing after kids go to bed. I start our routine at 7 and he hardly ever is involved so he could actually play for 3 hours a night. But that isn't good enough for him.


Edit to add: when a new game comes out he will literally take days off of work to play it. When the fuck do I get to take off 24-72 hours off of doing all the parenting and housework?  He doesn't see a problem with this at all!!!"

Parenting,video games,jqf30i,My nine-year-old son overreacts when he loses video games,"Hi, my son tends to overreact when he loses at a video game). It usually triggers a crying bout but sometimes full-blown rage. Fortunately he doesn't break anything or hurt himself when he does. He is able to self-soothe and calms down fairly quickly, but will have another outburst a few minutes later.

This is probably a normal thing he'll outgrow, but part of me wants to use it to teach him emotional regulation, which I do all the time, with fair success. With video games, however, I haven't made any progress. During the fit, I try to distract him from the game but that only makes it worse. I've had chats with him when he's calmer, and he understands, but I've seen no change in his reactions yet.

He's otherwise a good boy, pretty smart too, and I get no complaints from his teachers.

Is there a way to help him work through this or will I only make it worse and I should just wait for him to outgrow it?"
Parenting,video games,k01i0s,Playing Video Games Together Leads to Dinner Table Discussion on Learning,"I've been doing one-on-one video gaming sessions with my daughters (6 & 8) since the beginning of this year. Rather than just playing kid games or educational games, I've been choosing games which can help them develop in a particular area or start thinking about life in a different way.

With my older daughter, we started playing The Witness, which is a game focused on doing maze puzzles with increasing difficulty and complexity. She and I have been talking about how the game has you learn one type of puzzle in one area and another in a different area, and then starts combining them together to make much more interesting puzzles.

Anyway, during dinner yesterday, she started talking about how at school, it's just like the game. She learns lots of different things in her classes and then has to put them together. The examples she gave were learning counting, then addition and subtraction, then multiplication in math. Each one builds on the last one. This led to a general discussion about how learning is finding different building blocks and putting them together to understand something more complex.

I plan to put together a video about this when we are finished with the game, but I was really excited to see her start use our discussions while we play together to help her understand her other life experiences better."

His grades are declining, and his behaviour is growing worse. If we turn off the Wi-Fi in an attempt to seize his playing, he throws a fit. He screams and yells at us, saying terrible things like that he might as well be dead. He threatens to take his own life whenever he doesn't get something his way, which makes disciplining him seem hopeless and terrifying. On two separate occasions he has called his friends saying he intends to kill himself. Both times, his friends have alerted authorities, and he has been taken to an adolescent psychiatric treatment center. The first time he stayed for 3 days, and the second time it was an overnight stay. We've taken him to 2 therapists, but he claims he's gaining nothing from it, and the advice we are receiving from the therapists is to limit his video game playing.

Parenting,video games,gqrep7,Parents: When was the right time to start playing video-games with your children?,"During my childhood I played a lot of video games. Trough gaming I had a lot of fun playing together with friends and learned a lot, which I can use today in my work as a designer, but I also expirienced the addicitve side of gaming trough teenage-years.


Today as a parent I would like to share the fun of gaming together with my kids (6y + 4y) but don’t know when it’s the right time to get them introduced to video-games.
I tried once to show them a jump’n’run-game on the SNES, and my older son was (understandably) so excited, that from that moment on he only wanted to play that game. Everything else (drawing, playing Lego, going outside) was suddenly not as interesting anymore, so my wife and I decided to put the games away and wait until they’re older.


So I wondered how did you manage this?"
Parenting,video games,acitf0,Teenager wants a TV in his bedroom to play video games without being bothered. Husband and I unsure of whether or not to allow it.,"I have two kids. My oldest is a 14 year old boy and my younger is a 6 year old girl. They get along well for being so far apart in age. 

We have a 3 bedroom house with a bonus room. The bonus room kind of serves as a playroom for my daughter, a game room for my son, a man cave for my husband, and an all purpose kind of room for me. It's not a huge room but we have designed it so that there is a couch, love seat, and beanbag on one side that are in front of the TV. Behind the couch is my daughter's play area. We prefer for there not to be toys in the bedrooms because they are easier to manage in the playroom and she doesnt stay up late playing with toys. This normally works well. 

It doesn't work out well when my son wants to invite friends over to play video games or sleepover and his sister is playing with her toys right behind them. We do sometimes tell her to bring the toys downstairs but that isn't always possible. Her dollhouse for example is too big to carry up and down the stairs and she has so many different dolls. She doesn't bother them but he says he wants privacy when he has friends over so they don't have to censor themselves. I get that, which is why I usually encourage her to come out of the room when he has friends over. There are times when they both have friends over though and I don't want her and her friends playing out in the family room. 

The other issue is when someone else is using the bonus room to watch TV. My son gets annoyed that he can't play video games because the TV is being used. We do have a TV in the family room but I don't want the TV hooked up to gaming systems in the family room. 

My son has suggested using an old TV that we have as his bedroom TV. None of us have TV's in the bedrooms and I'm not so sure about the idea. I have heard that it can cause issues with sleeping and I don't want him to isolate himself in his bedroom. He plays in the bonus room right now and we walk in and out freely. In his bedroom he would be much more isolated. 

Disclaimer: Video games don't control his life. He plays sports in the fall and spring but doesn't do a winter sport. That combined with weather make him stay in the house more and play video games but he still spends time outside with friends. He has friends coming over today and this debate started again because my daughter already had a playdate scheduled and both want to use the bonus room. "

Parenting,video games,ie3flp,Husband playing video games while watching baby,"Let me start by saying I LOVE video games, it is one of my favorite hobbies and this is not an anti video game post by any means. Pretty much just want to know if I'm being unreasonable. So my husband is great with our 4 month old daughter but he has the annoying habit of playing video games while she is in her rocker facing towards him. He will do it when I'm sleeping in in the morning (I do night duty and she's going through a sleep regression so I try to catch a couple hours in the morning) or if I'm in the other room doing some stuff for work. I go back to work full time next week and I will be working from home for now with covid and I don't want to be distracted thinking that she is not being tended to enough. And soon I'll have to go back to the office and he will be her caretaker all day. 

For example, yesterday I was working in our office and I heard her babbling, like annoyed get me out of this chair babbling and I let it go for like ten minutes until I finally went in the living room and told husband who was playing a game that she sounded annoyed and bored. I mean watching him watch a screen is not very stimulating..so he got upset a bit and said I shouldn't boss him around. I just want to make sure she is getting enough attention and I'm also not a fan of leaving her in rocker too long, paranoid of flat head. I could see him leaving her in there and playing a game 2 or so hours every day if she put up with it and I wasn't here to nag about getting her out/playing with her etc. 

Anyway I've mentioned this to him before, that I'd like him to limit playing video games to when she is napping and he stopped for a while but is doing it again. Am I being unreasonable in thinking I should bring it up again?"

I know I personally did very similar things as a child and my father was very strict and I have some resentment towards him for it. I was very excited for the PlayStation five I was planning on getting two of them for him and me so we can play together but with his behavior lately I feel like I will be rewarding bad behavior and I’m not really sure how to handle this I don’t want to take video games completely away because I love them and I wish I could share them with him I’m just very confused and looking for advice."
Parenting,video games,64da9v,Child is addicted to video games,"A little background, because I think it's kind of relevant. I recently acquired full physical and legal of my ten year old son. Before, he was coming up to visit me during the summer from a different state. 

During the summers that he came up, we would play games but we did other things, like biking, going out and walking places, swimming, just doing non-screen activities.

Well, over the years that he was not with me he began to gain more weight and become more sedentary, which is the problem now.

Gaming is his life. His dream is to become a famous 
Youtuber(Markiplier and JackSepticEye are his heroes, even though I think they're killing his brain cells), making video game content and he actively works towards that dream by recording videos on his inexpensive smart phone. I would never want to take that dream away from him.

But he treats his games like a drug. He's unhappy if he doesn't have them. All he thinks about is the next time he can play. If I'm having a conversation with him and the conversation begins to trail off, he'll always tell me something that is from a game or youtube video that he watched. I can tell it's always on his mind. He has no other hobbies or interests.

His exercise and motivation have plumetted. He is considered to be overweight, bordering on childhood obesity.

Other people I have asked have recommended taking them away from him altogether. I agree, he should go through a 'rebhab' period where he finds other things to enrich his life.

But, here's the problems...

He has no other hobbies/interests. When he is punished for bad behavior and games are taken away from him, all he does is sit and sleep.

He's made several friends online. All these friends that are his age all play on Xbox Live. I hear them talking all the time while playing different games.

He doesn't have any friends that he hangs out with in real life. He transferred to a local school mid-semester on the last year of lower-elementary. All friend groups and cliques have been established and most of these kids have been together since kindergarten. For 5th grade, all the kids from his school and 3 other schools in our district will be going to a different school in our district. I think/hope it will be easier for him to find and out-of-school friend.

Does anyone have any advice? I'm a single dad and I've never really had to be an enforcer of rules, since I only ever saw him in the summers and he was very active at the time.

A couple edits:
He does have a daily limit of 2 hours on weekdays, 4 on weekends and 6 during summer breaks(mostly for when I'm at work and I can't enforce a time limit otherwise) After this time, he must stand if he wishes to continue to play/watch youtube.

Someone suggested coding and that was a very good idea. hes been asking for a laptop(I would get him something small, old, and refurbished) but I'm afraid he would use that for youtube/other games. Maybe I can get it, but he can only use it when I'm with him?"
Parenting,video games,i0mgps,My (15m) refuses to do anything with the family or friends outside of playing video games.,"Yesterday was an eye opening experience. My husband and I took our kids 15m and 14f on the boat to do some inlet fishing and hanging out on the beach. He was upset because he ""hates fishing and the water"". We made him go any way. He is motivated by money so we had a bet who ever had the biggest fish would win $100. He refused to participate. He refused to put sunscreen on or feet in the water because he hates the water etc. He was raised going to the beach, boats, jet ski, kayaking etc. He was just on a jet ski last summer loved it. He asked him what he would like to do as a family the he would enjoy. His response ""nothing"". He got invited go on vacation with his friends. He said no because ""I hate the water and beach"". There was going to be more things to do other then the water and beach. Because of Covid-19 he is spending alot or all of his free time online with friends or watching YouTube. He does chores poorly and i have he do it again. He cooks breakfast and lunch for himself and dinner for the family ever other day with my help. (My daughter does it on the days he doesnt). Something new we started during the summers. All I ask was for 2x a month on the weekend to spend a family day with us. He will just watch YouTube on his phone and if I take that away he just goes to sleep no matter where we are at. My thoughts were to cut down his internet time greatly until he can participate or have an input. I understand he is being a teenager. I'm trying to give him room to grow. We have even tried to play games with him, husband and I both play video games, trying to bound over something he likes. Nothing he refuses. He was in counseling before Covid-19, but didn't want to participate. Im at a lost on what to do. Do we show tough love and continue to force him to do family stuff 2x a month or just give up? I'm more concerned if this is a deeper problem or im just being too emotional."
Parenting,video games,j1fy77,Super fun video games to play with your 7y old.,"Mom and I are gamers, and we want to share this with our 7y old girl. She loves to play but games like overcooked, which she can do is a bit hard to do and also is a lot of yelling (playful yelling but it is intense if you played it), other coop games are to violent especially in the fantasy rpg genre we like. So after a bit of hunting I found some you may like.

1. Our favorite thus far is Cat Quest II, you play as a cute cat and dog to save the universe from a catalysm (sorry had to). It is cute, very easy to play but also difficult ratches up to stay engaged, all the rpg elements you want. $15
2. Guacamelee 2! Looks fun but haven't played it yet. Mexican themed super hero platformer like super metroid with monsters from our heritage. Looks super fun, downloaded it but haven't played due to cat quest. $23 with all dlc
3. Rayman legends, super fun quirky side scroll platformer with lots of coop action. Think like Mario world but wackier, great soundtrack too. $5
4. Overcooked- fun coop cooking game but can get hard quickly - $20
5. Tricky towers - tower building game. Not violent at all. Its like tetris but outside with wind, snow, and magic to help or stop each other. we played this a lot. Too much that she is soo good now lol. $20
6. Monopoly & uno - yup in digital. Good for just relaxing, monopoly has a speed game which is helpful. Monopoly gets old. $10, $5
7. Towerfall Assention? Old school platformer where you can coop fighting monsters with a bow. Not gory but you are shooting things. It is super fun but gets hard about midway through. We should be able to beat it through. This one is local/online coop up to 4 players so the whole family can play even if our 4y old just dies a bunch :) $20
8. Street fighter V super mega thunder overly long name edition - well street fighter with more characters just for some good button mashing. Taught her a haduken and now she is pretty tough lol.

Half of these come with psnow, including lego games so thats a pretty good deal if you are into it for $10/mo. Ide say no to each access on ps4 

So why not the lego games? They're great but for whatever reason they make me dizzy and naucious so I can't play them with her, especially lego world.

Anyway - if you have any good titles throw them in here. Take care."

Parenting,video games,f6njho,12 yr old son spending way too much time on video games.,"Hi I have a 12 old son who spends the rest of his day when he gets home from school behind the computer screen. I’ve told him that if he doesn’t start getting up and going outside for some exercise than I’m gonna take the game away. He’s obsessed with Bo4 and is nonstop on it. He’s very good at the game and has tons of followers on YouTube but honestly I don’t like him playing it for several hours. He’s a good at school, comes home and does his homework than he will get on his game and never get back up. He goes outside at school he says and runs track but I don’t think it’s good for him to sit hours and hours when coming home from school. He is obsessed over how many followers he has on YouTube and he loves his friends to watch his streams. I can understand that but he needs to get up every once and awhile. He was prescribed glasses last year because he couldn’t see due to too much computer time and eye strain. So I made a schedule last year. When he can play and when he can’t. Well he keeps going behind the schedule and getting on when I’m at work and stuff. I don’t know what to do. So I said screw it with the schedule and here I am. I need help. How do I get him off this game?"
Parenting,video games,d8wtkw,My son (7yo) wakes up in the middle of the night to play video games.,"As the title says, he will often (at least once a week) get up in the middle of the night and sneak downstairs to play on the PlayStation/watch TV. Sometimes he has bed wet (we're waiting on a referral to the urinary clinic) and I think that's what's disturbed him, but sometimes not.
I've just found him again at 2.30am hiding in my living room as he heard me come downstairs to get painkillers for an ear infection.

He ends up really tired for school and I don't know what to do. He knows how to operate the TV without the remote, so hiding that doesn't help."
Parenting,video games,3rwoxt,Kid's teacher seems convinced that his media time (esp. video games) is holding back his school work during school hours,"My kid is 12, in 6th grade. He transferred from a Montessori school to public in 5th grade. 5th grade went quite well all things considered. 

Not so this year. He seems to have a personality conflict with his teacher. Frankly I think he thinks she doesn't like him and that stops him from asking her simple questions etc. The other day he had a problem doing an assignment in class and had an emotional ""lockup"" and didn't ask her for help or start his assignment. She asked him to start working on it and then 5 minutes later (when he still hadn't worked on it) sent him to the office. 

His grades last term were atrocious -- in her class. Did pretty good in other classes but this teacher makes up the bulk of his classes. Most of the lost points were for missing assignments. It seems like an organization problem, which we are addressing. 

During conference time she seemed stunned that he has unlimited TV/gaming time after his homework and chores are done. We agreed to limit him to 1.5 hours of TV/gaming on school nights (after chores and homework). She brought _that_ up the other day, implying that this was the actual problem behind his poor school work. I suspect she'd prefer that he have zero media time. I guess he's supposed to be doing arts and crafts or something the rest of the time. 

Personally, I find that very unlikely. But I'd like to double check. So, my actual question: **is there any evidence that shows that limited media time hurts school performance?**

Disclosure: I'm a gamer but I don't play much these days. Once in a while I'll have a binge weekend of Mad Max or some other PS4 game. I don't see any difference between that and regular TV/Netflix. I do feel that there is a bias against video games among educators that is not born out by the data (based on studies that I've read about regarding video games and creativity). "
Parenting,video games,ge0sh3,7 year old turns into a jerk while playing video games with other people.,"To make a long story short, he seems to have extreme difficulty grasping that what may be fun for him is not necessarily fun for other people. As an example, when he plays Minecraft with other people, he will get bored and start killing/griefing the other people he is playing with. Griefing just means making things more difficult, so if someone is trying to accomplish something, he will make accomplishing that thing much more difficult, or will destroy the thing they have finished. I have explained this to him time and time again but nothing seems to stick. 

What is really bizarre to me is that he has a friend he plays with often that does the exact same thing to him, and he hates it. But he puts up with it because he doesn't want to upset his friend. 

I want him, so badly, to be able to play with other people but he, for whatever reason, hasn't taken to the advice I have been giving (or trying to give, maybe) him. 

Any advice would he appreciated."
Parenting,video games,bdt5tk,Video games,"What sort of experiences have you had introducing video games to your kids? Is it something kids need to be able to relate to other kids?

My 5yo asked about getting Roblox because a few of the other kids in the playgroup have been playing. I've checked it out online and it seems like there are parental controls and other parents saying the game is kid friendly as long as you set the game up right. My daughter has played some educational games on a tablet, so we aren't completely unfamiliar, but it certainly doesn't seem the same thing.

Anyone have any experiences with introducing video games to their kids in general? Does it cause any development or behavior issues? Is there a best age to introduce kids to video games?

Also: if anyone is familiar with the game, is it something I can play with her?"
Parenting,video games,ezz809,"Son's Teacher calls and tells me that I'm ""traumatizing"" my son by allowing him to play video games like Fortnite.","Let me start off by saying my son is a good kid. He is the top performing kid in his class and he's in accelerated courses of math and reading. He is reading at a 5th grade level easily and he's only in the 2nd grade. He's very outgoing, has never been in trouble, and makes friends easily. He's a very happy kid. 

He had been asking for Fortnite because other kids in his class were playing it for over a year now. I was hesitant at first because I'm aware the online gaming community can be pretty nasty. However I researched the topic and reliable sources said it wasn't bad for his age group. So I got him a PS4 Fortnite set for Christmas. He was very excited and played it Christmas Day. He hasn't touched it since. 

He had told his teacher and friends at school that he received this for Christmas and that he had a lot of fun with it. My son had also been talking about dreams about zombies he had. Never scary dreams though. 

Apparently this worried the teacher and freaked her out. She gave me a call yesterday and said that she was worried my son was ""traumatized"" because he was talking about these video games, zombie dreams, and that he ""wasn't scared."" When the teacher told my son he shouldn't be playing games like this he said ""my dad and stepmom let me, it's fine."" She told me that she's ""worried that he isn't able to process the trauma of these video games and the violence they show because he was so unafraid of them.""

First of all: What the fuck? Is she completely unaware of the fact that all the other kids in her class talk about this game constantly? Is she completely unaware that these games aren't ""graphic"" at all? 

I outright told the teacher that was garbage and that my son isn't traumatized at all by that. She then added ""well, I'm no child psychologist..."" Hell no you aren't! So stop trying to play one and create problems where there are NONE!"
Parenting,video games,jxdp0i,Want to deemphasize video games,"My 9 year old son seems to be obsessing about video games lately, even more so because of the pandemic and him being at home.  I limit his play to about one hour on the weekdays and really no limit on the weekends but if he's not playing it, he's watching it on Youtube.  I feel like he blows through his schoolwork and chores with subpar quality to get to video games then I end up getting frustrated. It seems like his whole day revolves around when he can play/watch video games.

I don't want to take away video games completely since I think this will make the problem worse but do you have any ideas on how to make them less important?  Do you have limits to playing/watching, expect them to be physically active, social, etc?"
Parenting,video games,5f5ooe,My 6yo has massive tantrums about video games and screens in general. Advice?,"My son still has tantrums on a daily basis, usually when he's told he has to come off the playstation or he can't watch TV. I wonder if this behaviour is normal for his age? I don't remember having meltdowns like that all the time when I was his age.

I don't give in to his demands ever, and I try to ignore him when he screams and shouts or offer him suggestions of what he can do instead (e.g. I tell him it's time to come off the playstation, he throws a tantrum, so I suggest other things he can do). I'm not sure if there's a better way I could be responding to him?

I try to limit how much time he spends staring at a screen to an hour or so a day, because I don't think it's good for his development, but I think if it was up to him he'd literally just sit on that playstation all day every day.

He's an only child and also has tantrums when his friends come round and have to go home, or when I pick him up from their houses. I think his behaviour is pretty embarrassing, especially when his friends can be so well-behaved when they visit! I worry his friends will find him embarrassing too and/or he might get teased at school.

What can we do about this? My partner and I are pretty much at the end of our tethers.

Edit: Thanks for all the helpful responses. I do give him warnings 5 min or so before he has to stop watching or playing, but I'm probably not consistent enough with it. I think I will buy a timer for the warnings and also implement a ""screen token"" system."
Parenting,video games,debxx0,Can I start a discussion about Screens/video games?,"I have an 11 and a 13 year old and this has become a continuous topic for us. I try to limit the screen time but there just seems to be all these exceptions that pop up. Friends are over, they finished their homework, they're talking to friends, ect...  The hours they spend on a screen are way beyond what I'd like. 

And on top of it, they don't seem to want to do anything else. You ask if they want to do something and the answer is always no. Screens seem to be sucking the joy of anything else out of them.

What are others experiences with this? How do you manage this?

Thanks"
Parenting,video games,8xezor,Video games -- this is new territory for me. How much is too much? How do I know if it's appropriate for a 10 year old?,"My daughter has never been interested in video games.  She does not have a cell phone, although she plays on mine occasionally to message her older (grown and gone) sisters.  She doesn't have any type of social media accounts (I'm not sure if 10 year olds do or not, but she doesn't).

So this summer she asked if she could download Roblox on her Kindle.  I had no idea what it was, but it was the first time she ever asked for any kind of game/app (other than like Barbie coloring pages and stuff like that), so I said sure.  

Now it consumes her.  She plays on it every day and watches YouTube videos from someone called InquistorMaster.  I've watched the videos, too, and they seem pretty harmless.

I guess she's playing with other people online because she talks about ""friends"" in the game like they're real people.  She's talked about some dramas, and I've talked to her about not getting involved in online drama (fighting, bickering, etc.).  

She goes to a rather small private school, so her real-life friend base is pretty small.  I have some pretty severe social anxiety issues, so that kind of limits her, too.  Kind of hard to make friends when your mom never leaves the house.  So I'm not averse to her having online friends.  I just want to know if Roblox is okay for kids.

She's pretty much always playing or drawing while she watches the Roblox videos, and she only plays the game for a bit in the morning and in the evening.  She does other kid stuff like play outside and go swimming.  I'm not too concerned about the amount she plays (when I say consumes her, I mean everything she draws or plays now has something to do with Roblox).  I'm just concerned about a 10 year old interacting with others online.  I assume these are other kids, but it's online, so who knows?

Anybody have any experience with games like Roblox?  Is there something I should look out for?  I know my kid is probably behind the times technology-wise, but I'm just not a person who cares or knows much about technology, so it hasn't become a big part of our family life."

I’ve recently started letting my son play on my old video game consoles so he stops messing my boyfriend’s. My friend thinks playing video games at that age is bad and is as bad as having a cell phone, but I disagree. I first got introduced to video games around the same age my son is and I feel like it was pretty stimulating it’s not like watching random videos on YouTube over and over, I grew up playing games like Mario and Zelda on Nintendo and I think it was overall a good activity for my young brain figuring out the stuff on my own.

Parenting,video games,c0jldi,Children and Video Games,"My wife and I have two awesome kids - 8 and 10, boys.  Generally well behaved, smart, and inquisitive. Great kids. 

The oldest one is wildly fascinated by electronics and has shown aptitude for programming and computer science.  I bring him home old computers from work (that would be tossed, no theft) and he cobbles them together (with some help) to try and get them running.  He spends hours on his computer tinkering with MIT's [scratch.mit.edu](https://scratch.mit.edu) website, building games and other apps.  He loves getting robotics kits and trying to make them work, and has tinkered with a Raspberry Pi.  Most of what he wants to do is advanced for any kid his age, and probably beyond most teenagers.  He was accepted into the gifted programs at his school for technology and science.

The youngest one has an amazing imagination and artistic flair.  He uses paper, tape, glue, and staples to craft his monsters and landscapes that he sees in his head.  He writes detailed, wild stories in his journals and draws out the characters and themes he describes - often in detail exceeding his peers.  He's obsessed with monsters, in particular anything that eats people.  Last Christmas I made him a 24"" paper mache Audrey II from the *Little Shop of Horrors*, complete with teeth, tongue, and leaves.  It sleeps next to his bed. He's recently been accepted into the gifted program at school for writing and art.

The parenting advice needed comes in from an event this morning with my wife.  The kids have recently discovered multiplayer Minecraft.  They're obsessed with it and want to play **all the time**.  Today they actually woke up and hour earlier than usual, without alarms or prompting, in hopes of getting more time on their computers to play together.  My wife lost her cool and shut it all down.  Since discovering gaming, our youngest hasn't shown any desire for creativity, imagination, writing, or building.

We're both worried that his imagination will be stifled if he spends too much time gaming, but are disagreeing on how to manage it.  I want to set up a system of rewards where PC gaming time is earned by both kids for doing other activities that are unrelated to games.  She wants to strictly limit them to one day a week where they can play and force them to do other things the other 6 days.  We're at odds on this and can't decide.

Parenting,video games,a85e4y,When did you introduce video games to your child? Any advice for an anti gaming parent?,"My ex husband and I grew up in very different environments. My siblings and I weren't allowed to play video games growing up because my parents refused to buy a gaming system. One of my brothers brought one when he was a teenager but quickly became bored with it and it collected dust for many years. He eventually sold it when he went to college. 

My ex husband grew up with unlimited access to video and computer games. He developed an obsession. As he got older he naturally started playing less and less because of other responsibilities. He started up again after I had our twins and it reached to the point of an obsession again. He couldn't go a day without playing and the final straw was when he left our babies in the bath tub unsupervised while he played video games. We obviously divorced. 

I have since remarried and have another son with my husband. My husband isn't big on games. My twins don't see their dad much so they haven't really been introduced to video games yet. They are 8 now and are starting to spend more time at friends houses with gaming systems and one is asking to play. I'm hesitant because of the situation that happened with my ex. I don't want to raise kids who are obsessed with video and computer games. Is 8 too young to introduce video games? Do we buy a system if he likes it or wait until he can buy one himself? They have played some education based games at school on the computer but that's about it. One of the twins isn't interested at all but I'm assuming he will be if we allow his brother to play. I have seen so many parents complain about fortnight addictions and can't imagine going through that with my kids. "

My daughter is five. She is an amazing kid in every way possible. Super smart, funny, helpful, sweet. She is starting to get into video games. I limit her time on the computer. She only gets to play in the evening after everything is done during the week. On the weekend she's allowed to play for the same amount of time she practices her violin. But the other day she told me she hated me when i shut down the laptop. She literally became Smiegel in Lord of the Rings. Since school started we've been reading Prince Caspian every night before bed, and last night she told me she'd rather read game informer. And fell asleep with the magazine. My husband is delighted and even gushed about it on FB. I'm horrified. I know taking it away is not the answer, but how do I get her equally interested in other things?

Edit: Looks like the answer is exposure. And for anyone who may stumble on this post asking the same question, its ok to really hate video games. Hell, I hate them even more now."
Parenting,video games,70yfuc,6 y.o. playing video games while we sleep,"So my darling boy has ADHD, a high IQ, and a love of video games. He has learned that he can get away with quite a bit awhile we sleep. He sneaks out of his bedroom, leaves lights off, closes doors between the bedrooms and the living room, and mutes the tvs. Clever little punk. 

We have already put all the consoles on smart devices that cut power on a timer, and have confiscated all handhelds. He still manages to find something. Last night he swiped my husband's phone while we slept and spent hours playing mobile games. 

We are considering a motion activated alarm that can be put on a timer to wake us if he passes through a particular doorway, but don't know if such a thing exists. A general motion detector would give a lot of false positives from our pets.

New Semester is starting in January - Take the Xbox away?","My son 15/M lives with his mother (36/F) and I (37/M) and his sister (12/F). He loves his Xbox. He's introverted. That's OK. He finally met a girl and they text, see each other in school. He spends most of his time on Xbox and doesn't put in the study time for school. He failed Spanish this semester with 59% and almost failed Math2 (C-) and Chemistry (C-). He says he wants to go to college, how do I get through to him that this isn't the path to get accepted? I am considering taking away his Xbox, only use it on the weekends and school breaks. Am I being too strict? I don't want him to act out. His Xbox is basically his entire social life. I hear him talking on that headphone/mic and I guess he's got a whole society of friends on there.

tl;dr: Son failed Spanish, lackluster grades due to bad time management and lack of prep/study time. Take away Xbox even though its 95% of his social life?

Parenting,video games,6zodw7,Wife and I can't agree on video games - how much for 8 year old?,"We recently gifted our 8 year old daughter a Nintendo Switch for her birthday.  To nobody's surprise, she loves it and wants to play it all the time.  I enjoy playing Mario Kart with her, and would do it as much as she wants, but my wife insists that we are playing too much.  She seems to think more than a half hour to an hour a day is enough.

We make sure that her homework is done, and she reads for at least 20 minutes a day prior to even considering letting her watch TV or play video games, so it is not a question of video games preventing her from doing her normal stuff.

I played a ton of video games when I was a kid, but my wife didn't so we have a fundamental disagreement on what is enough.  My question is what do you all think is reasonable?  I tend to think that if she's gotten all of her other shit done, then she should be able to play more.

Parenting,video games,a48s74,Son is adamant about wanting to win against me (Dad) at video games,"Wanted to ask some fellow parents for some thoughts or if any of you have had this issue.

Son is 13. He has grown up playing games with me, one in particular, Super Smash Brothers. The new game just dropped and we were both super excited to play.

Except, when it came to he and I playing against one another, he became very frantic. Not in an excited, heat of the moment, kind of gaming but like he HAD to win. He's mentioned wanting to beat me before and it really strikes me as odd.

He mentioned tonight as we were sharing stories with his friends (who were over for the launch of SSBU) that he wanted to be able to handle anything that was spicier than I could handle. Just so he could be able to.

I'm not really good at handling spicy, so that's not quite a high bar... But the boy can sure handle his spicy food. :P

In any case... I really find this concerning. I'm going to have an open talk with him tomorrow but before I do, just thought I'd see if anybody else has had a competitive teen who ""has to beat Dad"".

I'm not very competitive. I always say, ""Good game!"" And ""Good job!"" When he gets the upper hand or does something well. I don't make any big deal when I win or even when I lose.

He's won a few times tonight. But it didn't seem to change his attitude much.

Am I reading too much into this?

**Edit:**
Thank you all. I feel less anxious about how he's taking his win/lose mentality. Sometimes talking to fellow parents helps keep things in perspective. Thanks again. :)"

Parenting,school technology,oyrkvu,10yo Searching Inappropriate Things With School Computer 😱,"I just got a message from the school that my child violated school technology policy with a search done at home.  Their filter blocked it and alerted them.  My child did a search about masturbation. 

I need some advice as how to handle this.  I am only slightly concerned about the topic but 100% peeved that it was school administration that brought it to my attention. School only just started!! The child knows the rules and had even spoken to me an hour or two earlier about the new filter the school uses and how too many blocked sites can get them in trouble. 

Previous year, this child was frequently caught watching YouTube videos on the school's device while at home. They would lose use of the device at home for the rest of the day. So there's history of sus activity and non-compliance with the technology agreement they sign each school year.

School administration will be addressing it tomorrow with the child. While normally I believe in separation of discipline. What happens at school is addressed at school and I do not further discipline. I feel like I need to do something because this occurred at home. 

How do I get this to stop? What is the best way to address this? Do I preparr them about what's to come tomorrow?"
Parenting,school technology,10h07ws,She’s proud of me.,"We found out my wife was pregnant in 2019 and it changed everything. 
I was a guy who worked full time and sold pot on the side to help with bills. 
I decided I needed to change for my family. 
Long story short, I got a second job and started going to school. My daughter was born in 2020 and it was the best moment of my life. While still in school we found out we were having a boy in 2022. Two kids in two years. By that time our lives had completely changed. 
I graduated in December with a degree in Mechanical Design Technology and landed a job as an Engineer. 

My diploma came in the mail yesterday. I opened it and my daughter(2 year old) said “daddy let me see.” I showed her and she said “whoaaa” and it was cute. 
Then she said “I’m proud of you daddy.” 
I melted. Tears instantly. All the 80 hour work weeks. The nights of getting off from my second job, holding a sleeping baby in one arm while doing homework with the other. Everything was worth it because of that one little sentence that I’m not even sure my two year old completely understands yet. One of the best feelings ever."
Parenting,school technology,107knm7,I’m 33 and Don’t have kids. I just adopted a 14 year old,"Odd situation but my wife and I have been together for 10 years. My wife has a little brother who is 14 now. He lives in Colorado and we live in Georgia now. I’m essentially a washed up software engineer and now I own a salon. People think my wife and I have our life together but we don’t. 

I’ve known him since he was 5 years old and apparently I’m the only real male/father figure in his life. Never realized the impact I’ve had on him with the little bit of time I ever get with him. Well this past thanksgiving break he staid with us and we joked about him moving in with us since every time he stays with us he learns so much. 

Within 2 weeks his mother gave up custody and now he is living with us and he just started school last week for the first time. 

He went from an awful school system, living alone because his mom was never around to now living with us and attending one of the top academy in the state of Georgia. It was my old high school, I use to be honor student, 3 sport athlete, D1 soccer and had a mom who worked all the time so I achieved a lot of it on my own. So I expected kinda the same from him.

I’m starting to realize that he is very behind, his idea of doing good is making a C+, he games all day which is partially my fault because I taught him how to build a PC at a young age and I use to be in esports. I just figured I’d get him into tech because when I was 13 I was building websites, putting on events, self taught coder etc. turns out he just games and can barely work technology. Not very outgoing, socially awkward. Just imagine a kid who sits at home all day with no parents and games all day. Zero critical thinking skills and I swear he can be in a house full of food and will starve to death. He use to live off Oreos and milk

I understand I have to take it slow but I just don’t know where to start he is an amazing kid, learns quickly but theirs just so much to teach. Also not sure if it’s just him or kids but theirs no respect for a craft. I’ll teach him the basics of something and he think he knows it all already. I’m just so lost and don’t know where to start. It’s been years since I’ve been in school or had to be a responsible human being and here I am with a 14 year old.

Let’s start small, movies/tv shows to watch to help engage and teach life skills.

Any board games or fun projects ideas to do play to engage teamwork and critical thinking skills?

How do you even be a parent? When I was young I was in sports and that made me who I am today. Responsibility, accountability, communications, teamwork, mentorship etc. I’m not going to throw him in sports until next year because he is just so behind still.

Right now I’m just focusing on being there for him and supporting him. He trusts me because I’ll never scold him and I just want to know more details so we can both together overcome this. He is learning that all he just needs to do is ask. I know eventually down the road we need to focus the shift to academics and I just want a head start before things are starting to be expected out of him"
Parenting,school technology,10pxhpf,10 yr old son refusing to do school work,"Hi there, I'm hoping to get some advice because we've tried everything. 
My son is 10 years old and currently in a grade 4 class, he is technically in grade 5 but he is currently learning at a 2-3 grade level so he is the only ""grade 5"" in the class. He is in a special placement class in order to catch up and get extra assistance. He is diagnosed with ADHD and ODD, and we are also in therapy. 

Long story short, he has always struggled with school, we had trouble getting him diagnosed so he went without support until grade 2. We have tried tons of consequences, in school and at home, reward systems, scribes, using technology to do work, he has a counselor at school and a therapist outside of school, plus the special placement class where there are only 8 other children and a specially trained teacher. He refuses to do work, he says it's boring and he hates it and ""would rather kill himself than do school work."" He wants to be a YouTuber when he grows up but when I explain he needs to do his school work to find a job or he won't be able to support himself until he's able to make a living off of that, he says he'll just die instead then. 

I am at a loss for what to do, he was moved to this program because his home school couldn't handle his behaviour issues as he gets overwhelmed in large crowds and acts out aggressively. Now he can still be quite mean to the other students and throws chairs (not at people) when he doesn't get picked for something, but it has definitely improved being in a smaller classroom. If we can't come up with a way to get him to do school work he'll lose his placement spot. 

Has anyone else dealt with something like this? Has anything worked? I'm a single mom currently in school and working part time in order to afford his therapy. All of my time is spent reading books and researching different methods trying to find something that might work. We know it's a self esteem issue and we know it's because he struggled without an IEP at the start, we just don't know what to do to motivate him."
Parenting,school technology,10dnx5c,Need advice/insight about my son (7) who has decided he hates school and refuses to go,"My son is 7 and in 1st grade. He's like me, he's into technology, science, and video games. He is smart, gets good grades, he reads above his grade level and is above grade level in math. I'm not trying to make it sound like more than it is, plenty of kids are as smart as he is, but he's certainly not challenged in school. He has always been stubborn in certain ways. He doesn't want to do what he doesn't want to do.


An example from early childhood - we never could get him to go to sleep on his own. Once he got in a ""big boy bed"" he'd just leave his room no matter what we tried. We could physically put him back in, but he'd just get out again. Over and over for hours, until everyone involved is angry. Eventually we lost the battle of wills and just started laying with him to fall asleep. We still do that some nights although we sort of resigned ourselves to it long ago, it's actually not that bad. I'm just trying to illustrate this part of his personality.


At some point we started letting him play video games, mostly tablet and then Nintendo, and he loved it. We have 2 other kids and it could be such a valuable tool sometimes to occupy him. We've played together, and he loves playing with me, we bond over it. He bonds with friends over it.


I think over the last few years we let it grow beyond a healthy amount. We've always had occasional transition problems because of it, e.g. getting him to turn it off to leave the house, but from what we hear from other parents that is super common. It has recently rocketed past that.


Just before Christmas, he started suddenly and aggressively refusing to go to school. When we ask him why, the thing he most consistently says is that school is boring and takes up too much time. When asked what he'd rather do, he says video games. We've ended up needing to take him kicking and screaming. All last week was like that.


Last Tuesday, we removed all video games. And starting on that first day he certainly showed addict behavior in terms of lashing out. Any time we try to talk to him about it he refuses to see video games as a reward or priviledge for going to school and doing well, he only sees it as we've taken them away. Oddly, the majority of the time he has been fine. He's started playing with regular toys more, he will still watch some TV, he's started playing outside more, he's gotten a little into chess, etc. But when the topic comes up, he has not really come around. He is saying now that he will go to school tomorrow even though he doesn't want to, but we'll see. I will not be surprised at all if he refuses.


We've tried to question him to find ANY other reason that could be related to this, and it does seem like there may be some social issues happening too. He has said school is ""overwhelming"" and that he sometimes thinks other kids are distracting, or he can't make friends with all the kids becuase there are so many. But trying to get deeper into this gets inconsistant answers and he certainly doesn't stress it as much as ""school is boring"" or it ""takes up too much time.""


The school staff is supportive, and will help us get him in the door and into class. They've tried talking him. They've told us that they do see this kind of thing with a few kids per year. But they are not telling them anything he's not telling us in terms of what the problem could be. Just that school is boring.


I always liked school, because I was good at it. He's good at it too, but doesn't care about that part. He doesn't want to do well the same way I did. When I think about worst case scenarios, this year could easily be the beginning of him just never caring about school. It's very stressful and heartbreaking to me.


I feel like we've royally fucked up navigating the whole video games thing, and have somehow created this nightmare scenario without realizing it. It all seemed fine until a month ago. We're going to continue to keep video games away and frame it as he has to ""earn them back"", but I don't even know if that is the right approach. Does anyone have advice or insight from a similar situation that might help?"
Parenting,school technology,10e2pew,Too much device consumption,"I'm starting to despise the amount of time my kids spend on their devices. I know i am at fault for letting it slide for too long but It's ridiculous and so normalised these days. We buy them game consoles/tablets/mobile phones because we know it's the future, so we can keep in touch (teens), help with their learning, homework and technology skills (young ones) but the amount of time they spend on gaming, social media, posting for 👍💕👀 And the things they are consuming is toxic 💩. Plus, they are becoming like zombies on it.

My eldest used to love to write short stories and draw, now all she wants is to post silly dances to YT. Iv'e always kept things to private but since she got a phone for her 11th bday, she is in loads of group chats and just wants to 'perform' and become a Youtuber. My youngest 4yo, just wants to watch videos of other people playing online games..WtF is this lool? 
And i get it, it's highly addictive, reasons why i no longer entertain FB or Insta. I swear them sites were impacting my mental health, and Fk TikTok.  Not to mention when the devices inevitably Break down, My kids have a mini break down too, expecting a sudden refix or renew as if Foods and Bills don't come first. 

So, Iv'e decided to ban devices for a few hours a day and replace it with reading books, craft,  drawing or painting for an hour a day (After school) at least. Is it just me who feels this way regarding our kids and their devices?? Any other suggestions are welcomed. Wish me luck mamas and daddos 🤞🏽.

Other people compliment me on how well behaved my children are so it boggles my mind how whiny and sensitive she is at home. Lately, she has a full blown tantrum if she does something and is not able to do it on first try. Like her piano lessons, if a song is hard. She gives up so easily. When doing homework at home, she relies on me to help her with everything even though I know she’s fully capable. I tell her to do it alone but again a full meltdown. Also she’s is very needy. Always wants to be hugged or adult attention. She doesn’t know the meaning of personal space with many people. As a toddler, she was incapable of playing independently or became bored so easily. Lately, all she wants is technology, but I’ve limited this as I see her behaviour is getting worse and her attention span is also worsening. I’m losing my patience lately with how needy she is or with the whining. She is a very intelligent girl, so not sure where the behaviour is coming from recently. Any advice?"

A couple weeks ago she kept everything rated G and now all of a sudden she's telling him he can do what he wants with her and she's calling him daddy. I feel like I can put a stop to this now, as I plan on taking her tablet away for at least a month and if she does get it back she has to keep her door open while using it. I am divorced from her father and I'm skeptical about telling him because I know his punishment is going to be super harsh and he's going to want to sign into her account and see for himself and I know she would be horrified... and I know he wouldn't let her attend this dance she has her heart set on going to. She's a good kid and she didn't send pictures or anything. Am I wrong if I try to handle this on my own and let her know that if she behaves this way again that I'm telling her dad everything? I plan on having along talk with her and establishing stricter rules. She doesn't have access to technology at her dad's house so she can't get away with anything at his house and she doesn't see her boyfriend out of school so they won't be left unsupervised or anything. I also planned on talking with this boys mother. What would yal do in this situation? I want my daughter to be able to come and talk to me about anything."
Parenting,school technology,10a739u,How do you control your preteen/teens cell phone use?,"Hi! So I (33f) am a single mom to a 12 year old girl. Her cell phone use issues are starting to really escalate and I have been on the phone with her school almost daily since she returned from Christmas break. Its clear she is not using her phone in a safe and smart way. (befriending people on Snapchat she doesn't know; receiving shirtless and below the belt photos of boys and showing other kids; sending photos of herself in a bra and thong; if she is sent something from someone else making fun of another kid she is continuing to keep the photo going, even if it is just showing her close friends; taking Snapchat photos with her friends in the locker room in their bathing suits, ect) 

Please no bashing.... I am genuinely trying to seek some advice and suggestions as to what has worked with other people and their own preteen daughter. Please share any rules you might have regarding phone use and what works... Do you have certain parental controls on the phone or apps? Do you only allow them to have the phone at certain times? Any resources you can share that I might be able to utilize to educate myself more on the technology or better communication with my child? 

For context... She does see her father weekly but he lives an hour away and they arent that close and he really isnt all that present or playa an active roll in trying to tackle any issues. She does have a ""step dad"" that has been in her life for the past 4 years but he is a veteran and his military like way of approaching situations I don't necessarily agree with and he encourages her to fight back or say something back to kids which is only getting her into more trouble for reacting. So I'm really quite alone with parenting and discipline.  

Her and I are attending a social media workshop tonight at her school that will go over safe phone use and various apps. I plan on keeping her phone during the day rather than her bring it to school, she is being set up with an in school counselor and I will be getting suggestions for local therapists from her. So I am really trying my best to get this under control now before it gets unmanageable but could certainly use some advice from others who have been there or are in my shoes. 

Thank you!"
Parenting,school technology,103o3yy,Cell Phone for Kids: What’s the Right Age?,"My daughter is 10 and will be 11 this summer, entering 6th grade (middle school) next year. She has an iPad at home and we allow her access to technology and social media, so she can already call/text friends, see TikTok, play Roblox, etc.

This strategy has proven to be great thus far because she always comes to us to ask questions, work through a hurtful or rude situation with friends, ask what certain things mean. Having the chance to have a conversation and teach her etiquette and social coping skills for the tech part of her life feels important in helping her navigate it at a later age, when stakes are higher and parents are not as involved.

This being said, she is one of a very few 5th graders who doesn’t have a phone. Most had them in 3rd and 4th grade. I’m not sure why this feels like a big next step but it does. Phones seem like a huge potential distraction at school, cameras, texts, etc. can turn inappropriate when a group of peers and no parental supervision is inconvenient (ie, the bus). We are considering it for next school year when she enters 6th grade. 

What age did your child get a phone? How did it go? What were the rules that worked for your family? I’d love to hear."
Parenting,school technology,yyekhj,Guide on how to survive as a single 19 year old father (COVID edition!),"This is actually just a rant phrased in my own creative, sarcastic way. But on the weird off chance that someone can learn something from this, glad I could help.

This guide is for those who: Have no family, have no partner, have no money, have no education, and live in one of the most expensive cities in the USA

*Step 1:* Understand that having a child despite the situation listed above is probably the worst decision you could make. Do not get someone pregnant. Especially not an ex during a one night stand who will dump the baby on you and disappear into the night out of spite

If you fail step 1, continue with this guide

*Step 2:* Work during the pregnancy. You have nine months to save. You may not have family but the mother does. Move in with her and her family and just work. The schedule that works best is: 16 hour shift, 2 hours to unwind at home with hobbies, 5 hours of sleep, 1 hour in the morning to shower and get ready for work. Most jobs won't let you work 7 doubles so take on a 2nd part time job and work doubles on the days your 1st job is forcing you to take off. DO NOT TAKE DRUGS. DRUGS ARE EXPENSIVE. DRUGS WILL MAKE YOU CRASH. LET YOUR BRAIN DEVELOP A SCHEDULE AND LET IT AUTOPILOT. It's ok if you lose track of time, if don't remember the last 2 weeks, whatever. Just don't stop.

*Step 3:* Baby is here! All that money saved can buy you supplies and equipment! What's that? The mother has dissapeared into the night and her parents have no reason to let you stay in their house if their daughter is no longer there? Welp time to make use of Reddit! Redditors are usually safer than Craigslist. Post on your cities subreddit explaining your situation and ask for a place to stay. Keep your rent budget between 300-500 per month and hope to God someone is kind enough to accept. If not, put baby into government care.

If someone is letting you stay in their basement for cheap, continue with the guide

*Step 4:* Make use of your time at home. Newborns need a lot of attention! Use all that money you saved up to spend time with the little one for the next couple months. During that time, it's time to get an education. Getting a GED online is super quick and easy, so make sure to complete that ASAP. As soon as you have that, apply for a tech bootcamp. Cybersecurity is usually a good one to go for. Ivy league schools like California Institute of Technology even offer 3 month bootcamps for cheap! You're now 14k in debt but they look GREAT on resumes!

*Step 5:* The baby is 3 months old now, and you're running out of savings. That's bad. The good news? You're now ""technically"" a college graduate. More good news? The government provides Headstart for your child for free since you're such low income! Put that lil  cutie into the nearest program and that grants you 6 hours of free time Monday-Friday. Time to look for a remote job.

*Step 6:* Coming to terms with the fact your certificate is worthless and you've essentially been scammed. No one will hire you with only a bootcamp education. You've wasted $14,000, and a bachelors from WGU would have been worth more AND cheaper. The silver lining? Sales positions.

*Step 7:* Abandon all morals. It's survival of the fittest. You and your child is all that matters. No matter whose life you ruin, no matter how many people hate you, it's time to sell insurance. As a college graduate, you qualify to work for a high end insurance agency. These are just legal scam centers. You will be informing people on the regular, that they do not qualify for maximum reimbursement due to whatever bullshit lies your manager wants you to make up. Everyone will hate you. But oh god, the commission pay. The more you screw people over, the more money you make. COMMISSION PAY DOES NOT ALWAYS WORK. SOME MONTHS WILL BE BELOW MINIMUM WAGE. DURING THOSE MONTHS, ONLY EAT BREAKFAST. SAVE ALL MONEY FOR THE BABY, THEY ARE EXPENSIVE. NOTHING SHOULD EVER CHANGE FOR HER. 3 MEALS A DAY, SCHOOL, BUBBLE BATH, NICE CLOTHES, DIAPERS. SHE SHOULD FEEL NO CHANGE EVEN IF YOU'RE STRUGGLING. KEEP THE LIL ONE HAPPY

*Step 8:* Use your sales experience to move into a legit sales position. Digital marking consultant is an entry level position you can get just using your certificate & year of sales experience. Become an account manager and work with businesses on their ad campaigns. Use the scummy tactics you learned in insurance to maximize profits for businesses. Stretch the truth, find loopholes. The more money they make, the more money you make. And best part? You aren't ruining anyones life this time. Just making people buy products that don't quite work the way they thought it would. An easy recovery, a learning experience if anything. 

*Step 9:* Climb the corporate ladder. Commission pay only works if you're working hard. Some months are a struggle, others are great. You have a child, you want consistently. Climb to a manager position, get a salary. 

*Step 10:* Rent your own place and move out of the redditors basement you've been living in

Sarcastic guide is over. I'm moving into a house this Monday. My daughter is turning 3 next month and she's both happy and healthy. I didn't talk much about the actual child raising part in my rant but she has never been without necessities. I have never let her schedule change. I think she's picked up on my stress growing up because she's got some very clingy tendencies. I've probably caused her to need therapy later down the line just from our situation. But we're alive. I'm making a comfortable living wage, starting from literal zero 3 years ago. I've had some weird run ins with her mom, her moms family, and my family all trying to take her from me. This has been 3 years of fighting, struggling, and luck to get here. I wish this lifestyle on no one. I can only hope I've made the right decisions to keep my child happy and healthy."
Parenting,school technology,zl5mvf,Question about tablets/iPads and whether your kid was behind in school,"My husband and I have been discussing screen time and whether we will give our children tablets. I am all for not having tablets but fear that my child might be behind when they start school. It seems a lot of schools have brought technology into the classroom with their students and I just worry that my children will have a hard time keeping up with the other students if they have never used a tablet before or something like it. 

&#x200B;

Parents who didn't give their children tablets, did you feel your child was behind in school because of this? Or did it really make no difference?"
Parenting,school technology,wsi3v4,Kid free space after 8PM,"How do you all feel about having a “kid free zone” after a certain time before they go to bed? Like for example, 8pm rolls around and your kids go play in their play area or their bedroom away from your living room or where you’re relaxing. They have their technology, toys, etc to play with. They’ve already done all their bedtime routines so no need for you to worry about that later. It’s considered quiet hours and they’re not allowed to come barreling in and bug you during “adult time / kid free zone” typically they’ll stay up to 9:30pm and then get a notification on their clock to let them know it’s time to go to bed (electronics auto turn off then too) I know there are kid specific clocks or similar items like “The Hatch” to get them used to timing and being more independent.

I need some quite time with my spouse after a long day. I start my day at 4am in order to workout before I dive into helping get kids ready for school and getting myself to work. After work consists of 5pm pick ups, dinner, sports, and other needs. By the time the kids go to bed, I’m basically ready to go to bed too. My wife and I hardly get 1:1 time with one other M-F due to the schedule. The little ones go to bed at 7pm and the elementary age kids usually stay up til 9:30pm since our school district starts later. I’m typically in bed by 9pm myself due to the early wake up so again little to no time for my wife and I or just individual quiet. Just looking to carve out at least an hour in the evenings from 8pm-9pm for her and I. 

Elementary + age kids. Obviously babies and the pre-k age group go to bed earlier (at least in our household it’s 7pm, they can’t hang any longer lol)

Anyone do this?"
Parenting,school technology,yx83wh,Parental controls for teenagers? Especially for smartphones? Feels like all or nothing.,"I'm not trying to go completely psycho, but my kid has behavior issues. Most would refer to her as a ""troubled teen."" I just want to find a middle ground between, ""I have a phone for safety, to contact my friends, any hotlines or anything needed for resources, and to use the apps my parent chooses"" and ""I have free reign to anything."" At one point she had a flip phone which was the medium point, but she was made fun of at school because we are kinda poor compared to others in our area, and after better behavior over the summer I bought her a prepaid smartphone. She has backslid in behavior and it is apparent her relationship with the internet  The thing is, she is 13. I looked to see if I could add Google Family Link to her device which seemed like a great idea but it says after 13 they can opt out of any supervision. If this would just lock the device, that would be great! She can agree to be supervised, or only be able to access emergency numbers. This however does not seem to be the case.

What I am looking to do:

1. Block specific numbers. During my child's time with her father she began meeting strangers on Discord and her interactions with some of these people are... problematic at best. However, on the no contract phone plan I was on, I had no access to block specific numbers. I thought since the phone was under my name I could do that or view some kind of call log, but that was not the case.
2. Possibly view incoming text/phone call logs. This is not to be completely crazy, it is to see if there are recurring phone numbers that are not local that pop up.
3. Be able to turn off data usage period at will. (Smartphone) The reason I want this is because if school is not attended I want to be able to turn off data entirely for the day. On or off. And control the hours it may be used.

&#x200B;

What I have already done/have brainstormed:

1. Discord is blocked entirely on my router. You have to be on phone data, which she had a limited amount so she could not really use it excessively.
2. May possibly block Tiktok/Instagram and some other big social medias until trust can be rebuilt. (She has been sneaking, lying, etc. and it needs to stop. She can have a life, but lying and sneaking is something that has escalated and I want to put an end to it.)
3. Have learned how to use my IP address to view what is being accessed via wifi
4. Will be adding Firewalla most likely, which will show me spikes in bandwidth to know if a VPN is being used via large bandwidth usage alerts to bypass the controls in place.

&#x200B;

If anyone has any suggestions or advice for parental controls for kids who are 13+ but aren't making wise choices with technology other than turning everything off and only providing them with a ""dumb phone"" please let me know. I will do the dumb phone if I have to, but she does have a hard time making friends here and has a few she has made when she came with me to anime conventions and such, and she does like to play games with them and stream things and I don't want to take that from her unless I have to since she has a hard time fitting in with the kids around here."
Parenting,school technology,zx9yr3,Questions about tablet for 5 year old,"Feeling like it's time to bite the bullet and get a tablet for our daughter who is about to turn 5. We've held off for long enough. 

Looking for thoughts on platform: iPad vs Amazon Fire Kids vs Amazon Fire Kids Pro?

I have heard that the Amazon Fire Kids gives much better parental controls, but I'm also nervous about starting a whole new ecosystem since we already have iPads in the house. Also curious about access to apps like Disney+ and Netflix etc, particularly does it give access to multiple account levels (ex she loves Finding Dory but it's not available for Kids in Disney+ and needs to be accessed on one of the parent accounts. Will we be able to switch accounts to give her access to that? etc?)

I know I'll probably get hit with a bunch of comments saying ""don't get a tablet"" but the reality of the world we live in is that she will be using tablets in school when she starts Kindergarten in September and we want her to be fluent in the technology that she'll be using as part of her education.

Thoughts? Advice? What do we need to know before taking the plunge?"
Parenting,school technology,ywi17u,A 12yo Nightmare!!!!,"Myself (35m) and my GF (38F) have no idea how to handle her kid (12F). At our witts end.

My GFs daughter R, has been acting out for a while and it just continues to get worse. A year ago she was suspended from school for bringing a knife after she told a fellow classmate she was going to stab her the day before. She has been in therapy and regular psychiatrist visits since. Everything was going well.

Fast forward 6 months, get a call from the school counselor stating they were told from another source that R had tried to overdose on her meds. She was committed for an involuntary psych eval. They said everything was fine and to continue with therapy and started adjusting her meds. Seemed like everything was well until the beginning of the school year. One week after she went back to school she suspended. This time for smoking pot in the gym locker room. She's since started drug counseling mandated by the school and completed a month of alternative school. She was allowed back to her school and 2 days later was suspended again for smoking pot in the bathroom.

Now she has a 90 day suspension and has gone completely off the rails. She is completely defiant with zero concern for consequences. She sneaks out at night and has recently been caught with a group of 17yo boys. She gets physical everytime her mother tries to talk to her. She has had all technology removed but still continues to sneak out.

We are at a loss right now and are seriously concerned for her safety. Does anyone have any advice on how to handle this? Or a program that we could possibly get her into? Any help is appreciated."
Parenting,school technology,z9xl25,To limit or not to limit internet usage for teen,"Backstory: My daughter (15F) was brought up reading books with limited access to tablets, phones, internet etc.  That changed last year when we decided to get her a phone to have her be able to reach us for emergencies.  Both wife and I are aware of online dangers and the harm that too much of anything can cause.  I work in IT and also know the benefits that have come about due to advancements in technology.  Internet access has literally changed peoples lives for the better.  Yet, I'm also aware of the negatives associated with an unbalanced consumption of online entertainment.  Having learned about 85% of what I know today by listening to podcasts, Youtube videos, blogs, etc., I knew my two girls were missing out on all the knowledge that is available online.  Therefore, we gave my eldest more computer/internet time around the time we got her the phone last year.  Before last year, most of what she consumed online was Youtube Kids, educational animated videos and Nickelodeon re-runs.  Last year she moved on to watching reruns of other TV shows and this year she watches Youtube Shorts mostly of people trying to be funny.  Prior to last year, she would read a couple of books per week (she can speed read as she started reading when she was 2yr).  Now she rarely picks up a book.  

Most of what she consumes online is entertainment and she can sit there all day if we do not interrupt her to do her chores.  Naturally, she gets upset when we pry her away from the screen.  She is in all advanced classes and is doing ok academically for the most part.  My concern is that instead of being motivated or inspired to learn new things, all her free time is consumed by binge-watching Youtube influencers.  Therefore, I'm considering limiting internet access to a couple of hours per day, especially on Saturdays.  However, I don't just want to impose it on her.  I'm considering waning her off it by making her interested in other activities.  The problem is I cannot seem to motivate or inspire her to do other things.  Not too long ago I told her I'd pay her to create me a simple app (she was introduced to block coding last year in school).  My hope was that she would do online research on how to go about it.  She was highly motivated at first but gave up the next day and went back binge-watching Youtube.  This week I offered to pay her to research content and draft an article for a new parenting blog I want to start as a family project.  Again, she seems very motivated and we'll see if she can pull through.  Do you have any advice for limiting internet consumption without actually imposing it?"
Parenting,school technology,zkz58i,opinions on this ? whatsapp forward,"It's all started with Taare Zameen Par, and then came Three Idiots saying 'leave the kids alone, let them become whatever they want'. The next generation of parents who underwent a strict upbringing, felt that they also need to 'leave the kids alone'. 
Exactly 15 years later, we have the generation Z and Alpha kids who are rude, insensitive, can't take no for an answer, doesn't respect parents, elders, even their teachers, can't face failure, doesn't want to do anything in life, talk back and be extremely ungrateful. 

The situation has become so painful that teachers in Bangalore are quitting their jobs fearing the 8th graders, teachers in Assam are being assaulted by 10th graders, two group of 10th grade girls fight on a road over a boy, a group of 9th graders raped their 10th grade school mate, contraceptives retrieved from High School kids' bags. 

What will happen to this world once they grow up and join the mainstream?. 

20 years down the lane, these kids are going to be doctors, flight captains, and other important positions (mostly gained by management seats).

Would you have confidence to fly on a plane which is being flown by a 2009 born Captain.

Would you be confident to undergo a surgery from a doctor who is born 2007?

We the generation X and Millenials who advanced the technology, have brought in a poorly developed next generation, by making them addicts to these technologies

We the generation X and Millennials have failed as parents 

We the generation X and Millennials are going to be totally responsible for the destruction of our planet in the next 50 years 

It is not too late, let's bring back the strict culture; learn to say No; it's ok if your child is scolded or if punished by the teacher; raise your voice to your child; do not read any posts that says 'better parenting'. The best parenting was done by our parents. Do not entertain your kids talking bad about their teachers, enough of being friends to them, it doesn't work,  start being their parents."
Parenting,school technology,yfyli7,Help please 19yr old and….,"** Clarification Me (M42), Wife (44), Son (19.5yrs)

I recently married the love of my life (42). I love my new son (going on 20), for the most part he likes me, he loves me and when he is in his very smart “adult brain” absolutely knows we do everything with love and want to help him transition into adulthood. His upbringing has been extremely light on accountability and responsibility, I do understand this not to be easy. 

His entitlement spirit is very strong. He feels he is owed everything. He is not appreciative without coaxing, has never had a job (before the one his Mom got him below 8hrs a week @$35/hr). Regular jobs seem beneath him.  

Over the last 2yrs there has been many many issues centered around heavy technology addiction. Many lies, hacking school equipment, intentionally smashing school equipment (sense graduated). Throwing fits etc. 

As a result, He has had long stretches without and reduced technology use, never long stretches assigned at once, he just keeps doubling down and making things worse for himself.

While it was hard, many great things grew from this. He started to hang out with friends (something very rarely done before), he was very excited about riding his BMX and Onewheel, he was working on business development (his Mom got him helping seniors with technology at the buildings he works with and we have been helping him step by step by step to grow his business creating fliers, price structures, practice phone calls, ideas, ect). He even had his first relationship. He has commented a few times that he is thankful for the new perspective, he sees the importance of time “to just think.” He carried himself better, more social with us, and was on top of his chores with a good attitude. During this time his access to technology grew and grew. (Every 3 days) Even if he slipped up, he would own his mistakes more quickly and it was rewarded with positivity and no negative consequences.  (Maybe prolong the next tech bump by a day)

As his use becomes less regulated into total freedom until 10:30 (the time he picked as being fair and helpful to himself to be a productive person), we see a downward spiral into bad habits, less social, less willing to be accountable when he makes mistakes etc. 

He has always been able to negotiate rules to help make the system work better for him. We welcome it. We believe if he has a good and “adult mind” about marking real rules he will feel ownership, more likely to be accountable etc. 

This is good until he messes up and the Consequences we all agreed on become too much for him. Then he digs himself into a deep hole that he knows we will not let him languish in, then he gets to negotiate new terms and we start over. That’s generally when we modify the rules. This is a loop I see as teaching him bad habits. 

The more recent larger revamp, he did a great job making a good system that allows him to earn privileges back. He was in a very deep hole and stacked consequences very deep into the future. Under the new rules he started getting back his technology after three days. We do not have consequences for doing a bad job at chores or forgetting. (Forgetting sometimes means doing that chore plus a little bit more or maybe one extra day).

Simple rules: 1. Don’t Lie 2. Get your chores done. 3. Advance on your business or get a job. 

Our emphasis is always about building trust, accountability, mutual respect and personal integrity. When he is in his “adult brain” he is incredibly intuitive and smart and sees these things. When he gets into his “child brain” he burns it down, and in my opinion knows he will get to start over with yet again modified rules. 

He has a therapist, we have a family therapist, we have a couples therapist. We have been following (for the most part) the advice. 

My wife is the most caring person I’ve ever met. She is a social worker, gives seminars on Trauma informed care. We always talk respectfully with each other and as a family. We try and make our hard talks end positively. We begin most hard talks with a reading of our “Contract of Love” 

We are at the beginning of another “burn it down cycle” 

Even when he is at his best we have to coax him along every step to build his business, and when his tech is back that goes away. A year ago he said he only wants to do the bare minimum for a job, and that living with us the rest of his life seemed like a pretty good plan. 

He says we are the assholes for taking his tech away for what would have been 3 days even though we suspended the consequence for a week. 

We got him a house sitting gig right after he lied. Instead of sending him out with just his phone with time limits we let him take his computer for 100% no limit also phone, under the condition we pick up where we left off when he left. Instead of being thankful, he came home and was awful. Horrible attitude, hacking his phone, not coming home or answering txts, and intentionally not doing chores as asked. 

Now my wife and I have a lot of tension and we are leaving tomorrow for our first honeymoon."
Parenting,school technology,yhc88r,Deep-ish conversations,"I have an 8 year old daughter that I started a Podcast with. She watched a lot of instructional YouTube videos when she was younger just likes the thought of putting out her own content. I use it as a way to connect with her and hopefully over time have a recording of how she evolves her critical thinking and view of the world. I am thinking I will re-ask some questions in the future to see if her ideas have changed.

So far we've discussed topics like family, the importance of her role in community, how to deal with big life changes, space technology, etc. 

We've stuck with it for 10 weeks/episodes now so I am curious...what are the topics of some of the best conversations you've had with your grade school aged children? Anything that may have been insightful, inspiring, teachable moments, etc? 

I'd love to get ideas for things I may not have thought of yet for her."
Parenting,school technology,wt8bue,The past 10 years of pictures and videos of my son growing up are all gone,"Google wrongfully deleted my entire Gmail and Google account, along with all of the pics/vids of my son growing up in my Google Photos. 

Like most of my friends and family, I trusted Google to keep my data safe. My photos, videos, emails, and everything else that were interwoven into my Google account of the past 10 years were permanently deleted. The inconvenience of it is staggering, but the part that has broken my heart is the fact that thousands of pictures and home videos of my son’s infancy and elementary school years are gone forever.  

I was even paying for a Google one subscription to have more storage space. Of course, I have posted pictures and videos to social media, but the good stuff is what you don’t post. Me and my son dancing in our underwear or having silly bath time conversations are just... gone. I was a single mom for 10 years and I made a point to record conversations and silly moments we had together, but now they’re gone. Videos of him reading to me for the first time, or him dressing up in a character and hearing the hilarious backstories he came up with, gone. Sometimes I would just prop up my phone and record us playing a board game or drawing… but now they’re gone too.

I came back from vacation on 7/25 and I wasn’t able to log in to my Gmail. Following Google protocol, I tried to use my recovery email to reset my password and log back in. It didn’t work, but not because I am technically illiterate, but because of Google’s broken system. My brother, who works in IT, along with 3 other tech savvy friends all tried to navigate Google’s help pages and account recovery with zero success. We tried for almost 2 months, hearing NOTHING back from Google. It said my account wasn’t able to log in to for weeks, but a few days ago it said “deleted account.” At this point, all of the countless resources and memories attached to that account are permanently deleted and unretrievable.  

The whole time that I was trying to get back into my account I couldn’t talk to a Google representative that had ANY idea of what to do. The Google help pages and account recovery process are a circle that lead nowhere. You will be at a help page and it directs you to another help page… that leads you back to the first help page, and it never ends. You are unable to talk to a single person from Google that can help you. If you call the Google help number, it has an automated system and if you select the option of trying to get back into your account it tells you to go to the help pages, then hangs up on you. I was able to find another route to talk to a Google representative on a few separate occasions and they said there is no department for helping people in these situations. The only advice they were able to give was to go to the help pages, that’s it. I asked if there was ANYONE else I could talk to at Google that could help me and they simply said no.

Yesterday I bought a new Google one account with the new email I had to create. I saw that they have LIVE CHAT SUPPORT so I talked to someone there. Being able to talk to a knowledgeable person from Google was such a relief! I wish that the people I had previously talked to about trying to log back into my account had let me know that this was an option. The only thing that the chat support could tell me was that since my account was now deleted it was unrecoverable. If ANYONE else at Google had directed me to this kind of chat support before it was deleted, it could have been salvaged. All of the precious memories of my son and I would still be here.  

I am completely devastated and beyond upset at Google’s incompetence. My whole life was on Google. So many accounts that were linked that I no longer have access to, for absolutely no reason. My accounts like Airbnb, Uber, Lyft, and countless others that I had great reviews on are deleted forever. I don’t even know where to begin rebuilding after this loss. I feel so lost and betrayed. I always thought that Google was on the cutting edge of technology, yet they couldn’t help a mother with simply getting back into her account. I will be forever heartbroken at what they cost me. 

I'm at the end of my rope and I'm not sure what to do.  Please let me know if y'all have any thoughts on this."
Parenting,school technology,vekh57,Helping to replace a laptop my son accidentally damaged - am I being unreasonable?,"Am I being unreasonable here?

I got a call from my middle schooler’s assistant principal weeks ago. A classmate of my son had their Chromebook out on their lap while it was plugged in and charging. My son walks by, doesn’t see the charging cable, trips over it, and it yanks the Chromebook off the other student’s lap. It falls on the tile floor, and apparently was damaged beyond use.

The other parent wanted us to help* pay to replace it, and said the Chromebook was $500.(*assistant principal’s words - maybe they wanted us to pay for it outright.)

Uh … excuse me? Who pays $500 for a Chromebook? And for a middle schooler? Kids aren’t exactly known for being careful at that age. 

I get it though - technology isn’t cheap. But from the sounds of it, this wasn’t completely my son’s fault. Yes, he should’ve been watching where he was going. But anyone who has ever owned a laptop can tell you that if you have it plugged in and charging, it should be on a stable surface. Having it on your lap with the cable across what I’m assuming was an aisle way is a risk.

So I tell the assistant principal that I’m willing to split the cost of a replacement, but I want to see a receipt or get the model of the device first, because I’m skeptical of the cost. I also ask for the other parent’s contact info so the school doesn’t need to act as an intermediary.

Weeks pass, and there’s no response from anyone. I assume that the other parent was told I wasn’t willing to pay for the full thing and decided it wasn’t worth the headache.

I’d nearly forgotten about it, and I get an email from the principal. He sends me the receipt for the laptop: $390 after taxes. The original price was like $480, and it looks like it was on clearance and they got it at a discount.

$390 isn’t $500. I get that it was the original sales price, but it’s not what they paid for it. I tell them I’ll cut a check for $200. Given how the incident occurred, I think that’s more than fair. I also ask again for the other parent’s contact info, as it doesn’t make sense for the school to still be playing middle man.

After some phone tag, I finally speak to the principal today.

He lets me know that the other parent insisted on handling everything through the school. He didn’t want it to be that way, and he didn’t understand why they were so incessant about it. He then tells me that the long delays in responses were because the other parent was angry that I wasn’t going to pay for the entire thing, and first refused the offer. They eventually came around, but it took some convincing.

I tore up the check and opted for cash. Between them being misleading about what they’d paid for the original Chromebook, refusing to speak with me directly, and now this news about them being upset with my offer, I was not comfortable with giving them something that has my home address on it.

This feels like someone being opportunistic and trying to take me for a ride. So no, you get cash.

Thoughts? Am I in the wrong here? Would you have handled it differently?

EDIT: I already dropped off the cash at the school. Maybe I would’ve been in the right to outright refuse, but I see this as paying for this to go away and leave me alone. If they try to push the issue further, that’s when I plan on stonewalling and being a dick about it.

EDIT 2: it was the other student’s personal Chromebook. Our district can provide them, but is mostly Bring Your Own Device.

EDIT 3: my kid wasn’t injured. I’m not even sure if he fell down. As far as I know, he tripped and stumbled."
Parenting,school technology,y1rqcb,My 9yo daughter used my phone to text a friend and the friend is abusive to other kids.,"The friend we'll call ""Sam"" -- Sam has spent the night a few times. Sam is high energy with parent who hands child unrestricted technology and runs away. Sam is in cheerleading 8yo (3rd grade) with my daughter. 

I noticed Sam saying some not-so-nice but not rising to the level of bully stuff about some other girls while she was here. 

Sam and my daughter were texting tonight when Sam taught my daughter how to ""hide"" messages on iOS by making the sparkle where you have to move your finger over them. Sam called this other girl a ""butthole bitch"" and then mocked a girl whom she called ""Chicken Leg Susie"" who was having a birthday party this weekend. Then Sam stated she still wanted to do something to someone named  ""Brea"" and my daughter responded ""Fuck him"". 

My phone is synced with my Macbook Pro so I get notifications of incoming messages. I noticed these ""invisible messages"" coming through and thought it was sus. Indeed they were. 

I went upstairs and asked my daughter for the phone. I didn't yell or get upset. I did tell her that we needed to talk about it later. That moment will be tomorrow before school. 

I'm not quite sure how to respond... I want to reply directly to Sam when she messages my daughter and tell her that I'm not giving daughter the phone for a while. Mention a bit about why. I'm worried ZERO about the parents of Sam getting onto me. I also want to tell my daughter that I'm disappointed. Sigh, parenting. Ideas? Thoughts? I will not tolerate my kids being abusive to another kid.. any kid, for any reason. I've seen kids get bullied 30+ years ago including myself and it was disgusting. I also will not tolerate my kids hanging out or being friends with kids who do that."
Parenting,school technology,vqo42i,AITA for banning tech from 13y,"My husband and I both work in IT (him WAY more) and we have always had lots of technology in our house as a result. 

We have parental controls and over the years have slowly relaxed rules as it was proven our daughter could be trusted. During the school year her phone would automatically lock at 10:00 p.m. and could only be used for emergencies. Since it's summer she requested the lock be removed and since she was at sleepovers I thought it was a fair request and turned it off. 

Last night was her first night at home since this was done. This morning I noticed she hadn't fed the dog or let her out so at 1030 I sent her a text (I am extremely sick and couldn't get up); when she didn't respond I checked and saw that she was on Tik Tok until 2 a.m. 

As a result I've locked her phone (emergency calls allows)  until tomorrow morning, put the night time lock on  and will also been locking her computer during those hours (a couple weeks ago I caught her on her computer at midnight).

I do understand technology and the importance it has for her in communicating with friends (especially when friends live far away).

She is also spending the day cleaning and organizing her room. 

As I said I'm sick so I need to know if I took it too far. I haven't slept in 3 days and fully understand my thought process is messed up as a result.

Thank you

Edit/update:

After she finished cleaning her room  she got her phone unlocked for 1 hour to listen to music while showering. After that she could use the TV

We talked it over and she forgot about the dog completely; she had woken up at 7 then just hung out until she fell back asleep. We talked about being more responsible and about expectations. 

Her phone is unlocked but nighttime locks are back  (11 until 5 unless at a sleepover)

For people saying I'm cruel. She lost her tech for less then a day. She knew it could be taken for as long as a week depending on the infraction and understood the risks but didn't think she would get caught. 

It was honestly a fluke that I noticed at all. I didn't want to wake her up if she was tired so I checked to see if she was using her phone and that's when I saw it.

Thank your comments!"

In this newsletter, we provide you with notes on Play More, Tech Less with Abby Lynch, an episode of Minimalist Moms Podcast.

Host Diane Boden, is a mother of three and the voice behind the top-rated podcast, Minimalist Moms. Her guest, Abby Lynch, is the creator of the u/playmore_techless.

**Save time and read our notes on play and tech.**

**Topics Covered in this Summary**

\- Setting a Healthy Balance around Tech

\- Tech and Developing a Child’s Imagination

\- Taking Control of Screen Time

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Setting a Healthy Balance around Tech**

Tech is a part of our lives and we cannot and do not want to remove it entirely, however, we do want to set healthy boundaries around the use of tech.

Research says that if you are engaging in screen time with your child and sharing that experience with them, it could minimize the detrimental effects of screen time.

Our kids need space to switch off, allowing time for children to develop their imagination.

It’s great to involve children in trying different things and finding flexibility in what works for you and your family.

Abby Lynch explains: Her kid wanted to watch her favorite show after school, but Abby didn’t want to make it a routine. She agreed but asked her kid to try something else the following day.

**The goal is to achieve that balance** and find a variety of non-screen activities that you and your child enjoy doing.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Tech and Developing a Child’s Imagination**

Imagination can’t be taught, and children need opportunities to practice creating images in their minds, consider possibilities, and try out different roles while practicing language through self-talk.

Ways to foster your child’s imagination:

\- **Read books to your child**. It promotes brain development and imagination.

\- **Give your child ideas** on what to do. You may suggest a role-play.

\- **Find and create things** in nature together.

\- **Put out some materials for children to play with** that would spark an idea of their own.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Taking Control of Screen Time**

\- Parents might feel stuck using screens and feel like they can't shift how they've been parenting in this area.

\- Take having a screen in your car as an example. You introduce it on a long journey to pass the time, and the next thing you know, they can’t ride in a car without turning it on anymore.

\- It is important to remember that you have the **ability to take control** because you are the adult. Reset those boundaries and communicate this in an age-appropriate manner.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Parenting Advice To Go**

1. Remind yourself that you're the parent, and you're allowed to say no to using the screen.
2. Talk to your kids about it. No matter how young they are, set boundaries. You may come up with a question such as ‘’I wonder what we could do instead this time?’’.

Parenting,school technology,wyq5xv,Extracurricular Activities For My Three Old Daughter… Ballet? Cheerleading?,"My three old daughter is an extreme social butterfly. She hasn’t been around a lot of other kids since the pandemic.

The local school district has changed the policies on what age can enroll into TK. Long story short, she can’t enroll until 5.

I would love to see her being active with other kids her age. Not being glued to technology. 

She’s amazing at call and response type interaction. For example, if I yell “D’oh!” She will yell it back louder and more enthusiasm.

She also loves to dance.  But I don’t want her to play competitive contact sports yet. 

Cheer parents? Ballet parents? What advice could you give?"
Parenting,school technology,u4g9zp,Advice on how to deal with 13 year old son who is stealing,"Note: This has also been partially posted on another thread (AITA).

My son (13m) has repeatedly stolen from us over the past two years. Each time he has denied it, even when we have found proof it was him. Last year he took my husband's (m48) bank card, added it to his google account on an old phone, and then spent $300 over a number of days, on a downloaded basketball game. We saw the transactions, stopped the card and then tracked it down by accident when we found him on the old phone, did a search of his google account, and found the card linked to it. He completely denied it was him and blamed his younger brother (m10). His brother has his own phone and never uses his older brothers. There were consequences - we grounded him and took the old phone off him. The new phone is on Google Family Link so we have a lock to prevent him buying anything without permission.

Yesterday we discovered that someone had made two payments on my husband's credit card - one payment for a laptop for $2000, which was declined, and the other for a bike for $3,000, which went through. We spoke to the credit card company and they refused to refund the money as we had been to the bike store before and used the card there, so they did not believe that the purchase was unauthorised.   There were also some incidentals at a local sweet shop - all under $10 each.

We went to the bike store where someone had spent $3,000 and they agreed to refund the money, minus the admin fee they get charged for refunds. They told us the order was placed online and printed the order for it and gave it to us. They said that it was a click and collect order. It had my husbands name on it, but my son's email address and telephone number. They said that they phoned the number after the order was made yesterday and spoke to the person who placed the order. They said that the person was clearly a child and was unhappy when they said that the card holder had to be present when the bike was collected. 

Incidentally, the store where the laptop purchase was attempted, is a 5 minute ride from the bike shop, so we suspect that whomever placed the order was going to go for the bike first, and then collect the laptop afterwards.

We checked my son's email and there was no evidence of an order being placed, but there was evidence on his call log of a 2 minute call with the bike shop the day before. We also found an email from the computer shop in his email and when we clicked on the account information, it opened in his safari and had his username and password saved. When we went into the account, the $2,000 computer was in the basket.

Due to one of the activities he participates in, he would have had a secure area to store the bike away from home, so we would not have known that he had it, if he had been able to collect it without ID.

Despite all the evidence against him, he has blamed his younger brother. His younger brother was on my laptop, in the lounge with me when the two incidents happened, so we know it was not him. My youngest also has no interest in riding or gaming.  He is only interested in playing on minecraft on his iPad with his best mate.

My husband had left his wallet out, and the card was still there, so we know the card has not been dropped/stolen. My eldest swears blind it was not him.

This is a significant amount of money, that we cannot afford and we are very lucky to have got most of it back. For context, he has a MacBook (required for school) and it was a gaming laptop he was attempting to buy.  He has a decent BMX bike and we have bought him a road bike (with the help of his grandparents) for his 13th birthday, which is in a few weeks time.  He is a triathlete, so this was to help him with training.  The bike he attempted to buy was a dual suspension mountain bike (we do not live near the mountains but he goes to a local bike park with his bmx).   He has previously asked for one of these bikes and we have explained to him that we cannot afford that sort of money.  We've told him he can save for it.  He gets pocket money and also, occasionally, acts as a ball boy at hockey matches, for which he gets paid $10 per game (we have encouraged this as it helps him learn about earning his own money).  He also gets given money by relatives for birthday and Christmas.

I just do not know what to do about him.   He acts completely innocent when we have talked to him about it (as he did on previous occasions).  He says he does not care what we do as he is innocent and did not do it.  He does have ADHD, is under a paediatrician and takes medication on school days, to control his impulsivity.  However, it is his complete denial of the situation, even when all the evidence points to it being him, that has thrown us.  He repeatedly blames his younger brother and refuses to accept that it was anything to do with him.  We do not believe it is his younger brother, who was on my laptop the entire time.  My eldest has his phone on him all the time, so we know it was him who answered the call.

I don't know what to do.  We've always focused on the difference between right and wrong.  We have used groundings and removal of technology as punishments in the past.  I generally have a good relationship with him and he will talk to me about things that are worrying or upsetting him.  Our relatives are overseas so we can't ask an elder relative to talk to him.

Any advice as to what to do here would be very much appreciated."
Parenting,school technology,xroeob,Rambling of a confused stay-at-home mom,"Prepare for my whole life's story! warning this may get long and is probably really off topic. Tl;dr at the bottom.

I am 32F SAHM of 2 boys ages 5 and 2 in the US. Our family is complete and we are done having kids. For the last year, I have been feeling this overwhelming itch to be doing something (tm). Something to better myself. Further myself. I just cannot figure out what that is and I am feeling very stuck. My oldest started full time preschool and my youngest will be there in a few short years so I'm feeling like now is the time to prepare myself to go back to work at least part time. 

I have a bachelor's degree in animal science and a minor in biology. I graduated college in 2012 and started a graduate program for animal reproductive physiology. I took 1 semester of grad school and dropped out because I was just really burnt out. 

I have been working in veterinary clinics since I was old enough to get my first job. I held 2 non-veterinary field jobs in college but always found my way back to the clinic. I started as a kennel tech and worked my way up from there. I left the field in 2017 just before my first was born. 

Now, I want to do something. I'm considering going back to school but I'm stuck on a course forward. I am done working with animals. I enjoy animals still but I dont have the same animal centered calling as before. I don't know if it's the fact that I am pouring every last drop of care and empathy I have into my kids and there's not room anymore for me to care for animals in the same way or if I'm just burnt out on the industry. I still really love the medical side and science side of it. I also have great customer service skills and customers typically like me and respond well to me. I think I want to make the switch to human medicine but not in a direct patient care way. 

So, I've been looking into a program to get my associates in (human) health information technology to eventually become a medical coder or related job but, for some reason, that feels to me like I'm going backwards. I already have a bachelor's degree, I'm having trouble making it make sense in my brain to be going after a ""lesser"" degree for lack of a better word. But on the other hand, I'd be learning a skill with an intended job at the end (which is what I wish I  would've done when I went to college the first time), I could do the program mostly online and at a part time pace so I could still fulfill my SAHM responsibilities, there's the potential for a job in this field to work remote which would be great, and it still has that medical science aspect. Do I have a passion for medical billing and coding? Not really, does anyone? I mean I think I could be really good at it anyways, but what if I hate it? 

The other options might be to go back to grad school for something. Or start over with another bachelor's degree in something (yikes). Both would probably require a time commitment I just can't manage right now or anytime in the near future. Not to mention massive student loan debt I've already paid off once before and I've already made the mistake of getting a degree in something with no clear end job. 

So, fellow parents of reddit, what do I do with the rest of my life? Where do I go? What career options do I have? Who am I? Whats my name? Where am I going? I need all the ideas, help, advice, career counseling and probably regular counseling lol. 

Ps: i know someone is going to ask about my husband. We've been together 14 years and he is extremely supportive and says he will support whatever i want to do. Which in a way isnt helpful in giving me a direction lol. He works very hard, long and varied hours so that we are finacially comfortable. He's willing to pick up the home slack as much as he can and pay for me to go back to school. But his currently, well paying job will, of course, have to take precedent so we can eat. We had an agreement before we had kids that I would be responsible for the majority of the day-to-day home and child operations so he can work the hours required for us to live and for me to stay home to raise our boys. He is an amazing husband, very involved father and supports us well. I have to fulfill my end of that bargain. 

tl;dr: I can't decide what to do with my life and it's driving me crazy. I have a degree and used to work in animal medicine but i dont like animals anymore and want to switch to human medicine but not in direct patient care. Considering an associates degree in a technical skill but struggling with feeling like that's ""lesser"" than my bachelor's degree I already have. My brain is scrambled and I need help."
Parenting,school technology,ty242q,English Teacher to Parents - go to board meetings and raise hell,"All over the country, and in my “great” state of Texas (who asininely thinks they have education down pat) school boards are making decisions that harm your children’s education because of assumptions based in fallacy.

No longer do most schools teach:
-spelling
-grammar
-mechanics
-sentence structure
-typing

And a whole host of the most foundational skills that your children need to succeed in schools. 

The justification is that standardized tests are the crux on which much funding rests so there is no time. The excuses are that these things will just “rub off” on students as they read books, which, by default, have good and proper spelling, grammar, mechanics, sentence structure, etc. Typing isn’t taught because schools think that since your children grow up in the age of technology that they will have that skill by default when they need it. Nope. Texting is not typing.

Because of this, your students come to school unprepared for the basics of education. Time is spent in my 9th grade classroom teaching basic skills and not analysis or rhetoric and the consequence is that students are falling further behind. 

High level students regress because they are in classrooms with students without basic skills, and since teachers need to think of the group, high level students are being re-taught things they’ve mastered long ago.

Low level students are passed along without actually earning their grades purely because administration wants to save face and “look good” to higher ups.

In addition, teachers are tasked with menial responsibilities that take away time from teaching your children. Know that a barrier put in front of a teacher is a barrier out in front of a student. 

I’m not complaining about pay. I’m worried about your children and my students. 

Admin calls us experts in our fields but doesn’t listen when we raise our concerns but will fold like origami whenever a parent asks a question. I implore you: go to board meetings. Speak up for your children. Force them to change practices and educate students, not just graduate them.

Your child graduating high school should not be the highlight of their life. They could accomplish so much more if your school boards would enact significant change that allows it to be so.

Help us. Please."
Parenting,school technology,tesgb0,Lost on how to parent my teens,"I have a 15 year old boy and 14 year old girl (experimenting with non-binary identity). I am a teacher and have been very successful with other peoples middle school aged kids.  With my own, I’m at a loss. My son is failing classes - no amount of encouragement or punishment will help him care enough to do the work and I won’t make excuses for him or do it for him. He is athletic but not interested in doing organized sports. He has a girlfriend who he thinks hung the moon(and she’s a darling girl) but outside of her he is driven by nothing - which I don’t think is healthy. My 2nd kiddo has anxiety and bounces between A’s and F’s on a dime.  2nd child feels like they don’t fit in and battle feeling like everyone treats them differently. We have strong family routines - home cooked healthy meals, reasonable bedtimes, technology available but monitored and limits, we get outdoors, drive them to hang with and encourage hanging out with friends, as well as “forced family fun” where we go out together. Neither kid in involved with drugs (as far as we know - but I truly don’t think so)  I hate that my relationship with them has become a roller coaster of monitoring school work, fussing about getting things done and any kind of motivation.  I hate that I feel like I am constantly switching between cheerleader and drill Sargent.  I don’t know whether to crack down and take away everything until they prioritize and turn school and interactions at home around or let the natural consequences be punishment enough and focus on the cheerleader part. I just feel like I have these beautiful souls and I don’t know what to do. Every interaction I have I say to myself (add that to your therapy list) at the end. Advice from parents on how you got through 13-16 without damaging your kids?"
Parenting,school technology,thi268,I am terrified of technology,"My kids aren’t even at the age where I have to really worry about technology, but I am terrified of the prospect of the amount of stuff they will easily have access to once they reach grade school. 

Pornography, YouTube (and it’s horrible algorithm), TikTok, Instagram, even Reddit are just full of trash content, terrible messaging, extremism, predators, and those are just the big ones.

A lot of adults don’t even fully understand the dangers and addiction of technology - how easily kids can fall into the rabbit hole of extremism (whether that extremism is proana, incels, racism, the list is endless). They’ll have friends who have unsupervised access to smartphones and tablets.

I don’t even know where to really start. Yes, open communication and exploring together. But by the time I have to really worry about any of this, I will probably be so out of touch with “what the kids are on” that I’ll quite literally have no clue. Heck, if I’m honest I don’t have a clue now! Three years ago it’s was kik and finstas and hidden apps within apps. I don’t even know what I’d be looking for on a tech savvy teens smartphone.

How do you all deal with these anxieties? And what are your plans for navigating?"

Parenting,school technology,v55se4,What do I do if my sister in-laws teenagers are a bad influence on my 10yo and 8yo?,"My husband and I have a 10yo and 8yo. We’re very close with his parents and sisters. ‘Lisa’ and ‘Sara.’ 
Lisa has a 14yo son. He doesn’t go to school, instead he gets high off weed, games on his $1000’s of technology with access to Lisas credit card. She says there’s nothing she can do because he has ADHD. Sara is a single mum with 12yo twins. They do a lot of naughty stuff but 90% of the time it’s influenced by Lisa’s son. 

We spent Xmas together on a family vacation. 
There was 3 levels. We stayed up the top and there was a games room on the bottom level. While we thought the kids were in the games room. They were sneaking down to the store across the road and stealing drinks and food. They were taking my kids along with them too!! When we found out Lisa just went on about ‘see what I have to put up with with an ADHD child.’ But no one did anything discipline wise, only me and my husband who made the older ones give us their Xmas money and we gave it to the store owners. They spent the entire holiday on technology, eatting the rubbish they had stolen, wrappers on the floor, swearing at their parents, throwing stuff etc
This is a big no no for my kids, though my 8yo son is easily influenced as he looks up to the older boys. 

Last time we were at my in-laws place, Sara’s son took my phone and messaged my 10yo’s friends on kids messenger telling her friends ‘f**k you.’ My daughter was distraught. I had to message their parents apologising! I told Sara and she did nothing! Then while we thought they were all playing hide and seek. They were just pretending, instead Lisas son had FaceTimed from his house, to get Sara’s kids to steal half an ounce of weed from husbands parents cupboard. And they did. In front of my kids!! The hide and seek was a lie so they had reason to be in the cupboards! The in-laws weren’t happy. But Sara and Lisa just shrug it off as kids will be kids and said they’ve been stealing a lot of weed lately they think they must be selling it at school. 

Now they can do whatever they want with their kids. But I don’t want this influence and normalising this behaviour for my children!! Hubby’s mum is booking another family vacation. I just absolutely don’t want to go but know this would cause a big upset between my husband and I? 
How does one approach this type of thing? 
Am I even justified because they are family after all?

TL;DR My husbands nieces and nephews are older than mine by a few years. They’re 12-14yo while ours are 8 & 10. The older ones thieve weed from their grandparents, stuff from shops infront my kids and also swear at all the adults. I don’t like the influence on my children? But can’t stop them seeing their family? What do I do?"
Parenting,school technology,vjattg,Monitoring Discord,"My 11 year old (12 in August) is asking for Discord. She says her Roblox and school friends don’t have text messaging and that they’re on Discord. 

She doesn’t always have the strongest use / wisdom with boundaries, but she’s also a preteen recently surviving our (her parents’) divorce, and I’d like to isolate her from her friends as little as possible. I also try to help my children to *practice* boundaries and all of the difficult things in life and technology rather than banning them completely. I’m sure many parents here will disagree with that stance with varying intensities. 

I know nothing about Discord, so I’m about to watch some “what you should know about discord” videos and read some articles, but I’d like to know the opinions of maybe some more experienced parents, if someone would be willing to help. 

A) Should I help her to try Discord : practice boundaries, etc, or will it be too impossible for me to help her be safe? (I understand that all internet usage is potentially risky, which is why I say “help” her to be safe, not “guarantee”.)

B) If this is something I can reasonably monitor, how? The Google Family Link website says that it can’t monitor Discord, and I assume (again, I know 0% about it) that any inappropriate messages could just be deleted before I see them. 

PS : I allow my kids access to an old iPhone (that connects to Wi-Fi only) and a newer Android that’s fully functional, so I need to monitor them on different platforms. I understand that I’ll have to sometimes buy multiple parental control subscriptions to accommodate that."
Parenting,school technology,tnpils,How do I help my gay son?,"Throw away account for obvious reasons.

I am growing more and more concerned about my (44m) son's (14m) behavior and I'm at a loss of what to do or where to get help. It's a long story, but I think the context is important. TIA for any help or insight.

Shortly after turning 13, my son asked me what the LGBTQ+ community center in our neighborhood was for when we were hanging out in our yard. I candidly told him it was there to help people who needed help or support - usually related to their sexuality or identity not matching what some people think are norms. I gave the example of some teens whose family's were unsupportive or kicked them if they found out they were gay or trans or any sort of thing like that. He told me he thought he was gay. The first thing I told him was that I was happy he decided to talk to me. The second thing I asked was how I could help him? I asked if he wanted to go to the community center or if he wanted to talk to some of our LGBT friends, a psychologist, or anything else? He said he wasn't sure and I said no problem. I would give him a couple of days of space and we'd talk again. I told him his mom and I would always love him and him being gay or anything else wouldn't change any of that.

I called a few close friends (one of whom is chairperson of the board of that LGBTQ+ community center) to get advice on how to support him and to identify a few avenues where he could talk to other people about what he was thinking and feeling (since I know Dad probably isn't the first choice). I asked him 2 days later if he'd thought about anymore and he said he had and wasn't sure he was gay and didn't want to talk to anyone. I reiterated how much I loved him and how I would do anything I could to help him.

A few months later, he had a girlfriend and even went to a couple of school dances. He told me he wasn't that interested in her, but she asked him out and her best friend was ""going out"" with a good friend of his. We never talked about his sexuality or anything related for the better part of 9 months. I'm not sure if it was the right thing to do, but I err on the side of giving space to people to process things on their own time and to try to make sure they know I am there.

After a few months they broke up. A few months after that, my wife got a call from another mom stating that she had seen our son send some disturbing text messages to a group that her son was a member of and she thought we needed to know what was being said.

We checked our son's phone that night and were horrified to see countless texts from him to this small group of four friends about our family. Our son had been telling his friends that he came out to us and we refused to accept him. I was devastated and heartbroken. As I continued to read, I began to see him share story after story about my wife and I that never happened. For instance, he told his friends that we called him slurs at home and that we told him that being gay was a cardinal sin. We even saw where one of his friends said he they wished they could murder us and his response was ""IKR"". <- This was the statement that the other parent shared with us.

At this point, I picked him up after school and told him we needed to talk. I planned my conversation out to make sure I delivered the message. Here are the points I tried to communicate:

* He wasn't in trouble
* I wasn't angry.
* Nothing would change how much I loved him.
* When I was his age, I made up stories to explain the way I felt sometimes because I didn't know why I felt the way I did.
* The threats of violence crossed a line.
* Texts and things on the internet are permanent and that could get him kicked out of school
* He owed my wife and I an apology for the threats, but not for anything else at all
* That I was going to set up time with his old therapist (ADHD), but that he could decide what they talked about.
* That if he wanted to talk to anyone else - people his age, people I know, the LGTB! community center, or anyone else that I would find a way to make it happen.
* That we were going to begin to monitor his phone usage, but only because some of his actions (threats) could have real consequences. I told him we were going to use software that only alerted us to key words and that we would try to monitor him in a way that respected his privacy.

My goal was to not interfere with the way he presented himself to his friends, but to make sure that he wasn't going to get himself into trouble. He expressed remorse and said he wanted to go to see his therapist. The therapist and I talked, then the therapist and my son talked, and then the 3 of us talked. The therapist was confident my son was doing fine and that this sort of fantasy world was just part of growing up for some people and that we only knew because we had texts, otherwise these would just be things he told his friends.

I should point out that during this entire time, we've seen none of this in our house. He's continued to show us the smart, funny, and kind kid he's always been. He engages with us, hugs us, watches TV, sports, video games, all of the usual things we do as a family.

Another couple of months went by and everything seemed fine. I got occasional alerts about language or other things, but nothing serious. Then I got an alert for self-harm. I pulled up the text and saw where my son had been telling his friends that he just couldn't take our bigotry any more. He told them that we refused to eat at a restaurant with a pride flag. He actually sent the text about the restaurant while he at the table with us eating in the restaurant. And that we started waking him up at 5 AM to scream at him and call him homophobic slurs. One of his friends replied that they didn't want to see him leave this world and that they were going to call the police because what we were doing was abuse and he needed to get some help. He said he wouldn't hurt himself, but it was so hard to live with bigot parents that hated you.

After seeing this conversation, I pulled him away so we could talk again. I told him about the alert and about how worried I was about him. We talked for a while and he assured me that he was happy and that he was just talking stuff and that he was sorry for the lies he was telling about us, but that some of the friends in this group had problems and it was his way of fitting in. I told him I understood and that I loved him and that if he ever did feel any of those things that I was here for him and if he didn't want to talk to me, we could find someone for him to talk to.

My wife and I are unsure about how we should respond. I am hesitant to address the relationships he has with his friends because I don't want to alienate him. I am worried that his feelings are real and that he might just be telling lies to justify them. My wife thinks we should confront him on everything because this is not who our family is and that we need to tell him lying is unacceptable and discuss potential disciplinary actions like removing internet/phone privileges.

His grades are good, his behavior is great. He's a great kid and if we weren't monitoring his phone, we would be utterly clueless that any of this was happening. I just want to be the best dad for him. Part of me thinks this is just part of growing up and the only reason we see it is because of technology. I would like to believe the engaged loving son we know (and still know) is the real deal, but part of me is terrified I might be ignoring some sign and that something terrible might happen.

I'm here because I'm just not sure what to do. I didn't have a family growing up and I don't know anyone else going through anything like this with their kids so I came here for advice. Yesterday we discussed making the school counselor aware of what's happening, but we aren't sure if that's a good idea or not.

Thank you for reading"
Parenting,school technology,rj7myb,Technology and Your Child (serious?,"Hey everyone! I am a new mom and I work in education. I have seen how technology is helpful to students/out children and a hinderance and was curious…. How do you all manage technology with your children?

How old are they? Do you allow your middle schooler/high school to own a phone? Do they get social media? Do you take their phones at night/or at random to see what they are doing?

It just seems so overwhelming to figure out a balance and I was just curious what some of you all have decided to do. Also, how do your children react to the limits you place for them if you do?

Hope this spurs on some interesting conversation! Hope y’all have a great break."
Parenting,school technology,txqkac,General advice on preventing technology addiction?,"I've seen technology addiction discussed here with teenagers and middle school aged children (11 and up), but I'm wondering if anyone has any thoughts about how to prevent this? I don't have any specific concerns for any of my children yet, just wondering if there might be any traps we can all try to avoid. Parents dealing with this, is there something you wish you had done differently?"
Parenting,school technology,if9dpi,I deleted my 9 year old’s Tiktok account...,"You can imagine how well it’s gone over.  She’s yelling and screaming “It’s not fair.”   I feel like and asshole, but after reviewing her videos etc, I could not let her keep it.  The song choices are beyond inappropriate for younger kids, the dancing isn’t really either.  I realize she doesn’t quite understand, but the idea of adults watching my 9 year old freaks me out.  She did have it set to private, yet there were still followers on there that I didn’t know or approve of.  
So, with the best intentions of being a good parent, I am sitting here being screamed at.   “It’s not fair,” “Why?!?!?.”   Because I love you. That’s why.


Update: thank you all for your comments/opinions and to the kind person that left an award.  
Now that she’s calmed down, we were able to have a real, honest discussion about internet safety and went over the reasons why the app just isn’t ok for her to use.  She is now back to happy self, playing a game with her sister.  
Some people seemed to be anti technology etc.  I respect your opinions and I am entitled to mine.  Right now, especially in this Covid world, tech is essential for our kids to learn and participate in school.  I am happy I can have open honest conversations with my kids about tech use and the internet in general.  We’ve talked about it’s dangers, but also how amazing it is that they can see and talk to 20 kids from school during a lesson.  It’s amazing that they can log into a google classroom and access lessons and info from their teachers and classmates.  In the schools systems I have worked, online libraries are necessary for kids to have access to books.  The internet is part of our lives and I would much rather teach my kids to use it responsibly than to pretend it doesn’t exist and let them hear/see/learn things from their friends instead.  
Be safe out there all ☀️

Update 2:  thanks for the awards and support fellow Redditors.  Glad we are all in this together to protect our kiddos. 😊"
Parenting,school technology,pzfkgw,How were you disciplined as a kid? Does it affect how you discipline your kids now?(redux),"Bringing this back after I deleted the original thread because I thought it was a little too personal; Trying to figure out how to undo 30+ years of learned behavior.

----------------------------------------------------------------

I came up in a separated household, mom and dad had been divorced ever since I can remember.

Birth through age 10, I lived with my mom...

Coming up in the 1980s, Discipline was different.

Every week at the grocery store, my mom would pick up a 3 pack of wooden spoons that she called her ""talking sticks."" She'd need these because she'd break them on my ass for spilling something or talking back or doing random kid shit. (I was a bad kid, LOL.) If the wooden spoons weren't available, I got the belt or the hanger or the shoe or the hairbrush or whatever else was within reach. (Asians, Am I right?)

Hell, even in my 30's, my mom will still playfully grab me by the neck and tell my wife or friends that she beat the shit outta me as a kid and isn't afraid to do it again if I get outta line... And I'm 6 ft tall, over a full foot taller than her and I've got at least 100 lbs on her as well.)

I was an honor roll student all through elementary school; went to a special ""magnet"" school for Science and Technology.

Mom couldn't afford to send me to the special middle school that followed. I was mixed in with the general population and started having trouble in school.

----------------------------------------------------------------

After I started having trouble in middle school, I got sent to live with my dad.

I guess he tried to parent with a gentler hand what with the timeouts and the restriction of privileges. But that didn't work, so he had to break out the heavy hand so to speak. LOL.

By that time I was a preteen or teenager, so it was fisticuffs with dad. A broken lip, jammed finger, black eye (For either of us) was pretty common after an argument... Usually over me not doing well in school.

----------------------------------------------------------------

It absolutely affects how I raise my current kids. I've never hit my kid with anything like my mom did. I struggle to not get angry and raise my voice when my son does regular kid shit. Luckily, my wife has the patience of a saint and handles him when he's bad.

My son has both a temper and ADHD like I do and I just can't deal with it.

Because now a days you can't even beat a kid without getting CPS called on you. You can't even talk about it without some asshole coming up and saying, ""Well you know studies show that corporal punishment brings up anger issues in the future.""

So where the fuck was I supposed to learn how to be a parent? What even IS acceptable discipline in this soft age? They don't teach this shit in school. In school, I learned algebra and science and history and English. Not how to provide a loving, caring, nurturing environment to a developing mind.

How is anyone who came up in the 80's qualified to be a parent?
Why would anyone want to attempt something they're not qualified for? (Especially parenthood, which means that you're entirely responsible for someone else's ENTIRE FUCKING LIFE.)"
Parenting,school technology,sitwkj,$$$ or other reward to get kids to read?,"Growing up I hated to read, and while a very good student I only ever read one book in grade school and it was one assigned in school.

As an adult, I'm an avid reader and feel society today doesn't read enough, non-fiction specifically,  and thinking how to handle a kid with reading. I realize you can't make a kid read, but has anyone had success by offering a reward or even $ to read?

As a kid in school my dad would reward me with a video game if I had a good report card and it was a strong motivating factor for me.

Just trying to prepare and learn how others have handled this.

I should note that I realize there are numerous ways to learn these days given technology."
Parenting,school technology,scdh2h,Navigating Roblox,"My son plays, he is 9.5, he usually just enjoys building worlds and playing them, but he’s always so caught up trying to impress others just so they’ll be his friends. It hasn’t been an issue, until today 2 of these “friends” who have been playing nicely with him for a few days, all of a sudden accused him of being a “hacker” (have no idea hey), and they both left the friend group and blocked him. 
He has never been so devastated. I think he doesn’t understand why and it was his first time he felt included. 
Is it even worth reporting these kids? Or will it do nothing? 
I’m trying to take this as a real life learning experience, that online friends are different to his school friends and he wouldn’t have learnt this any other way. Regardless it is heartbreaking to watch him cry into the night. 
I’m not going to ban it and punish him and I’m a firm believer of learning to coexist with technology the best you can without excluding it from your life."
Parenting,school technology,od402o,My child (12) told me I’m “flexing on them” the things they cannot/don’t have.,"So it’s a complicated story with my daughter. We got out of an abusive situation with her dad a while back, and I’m trying to get her to attend therapy. So far it hasn’t really worked. She refuses to do a virtual visit and acts like she won’t get in the car if I say let’s go. I do want her in therapy, but if she won’t talk or do anything there’s not much I can do. She ran away from her dad’s about six months ago when shit “hit the fan” and I found out he was treating her that way trying to go to someone she met on Discord. I got her back after that and obviously her access to that is now gone because she isn’t old enough to handle the responsibility of talking to strangers online (and I wouldn’t have thought so anyway, but she was with her dad at the time).

Today we were talking and it came up that I felt like I can’t trust her to stay alone again even for short periods because of what happened. She and I had talked before and she did say the situation with her dad and how bad he was is what caused her to run away. I asked her if she thought she was being treated better and if things were better and she said I was “almost as bad” as her dad, who was physically and emotionally abusive. I do not hit my child and I try not to even yell. I try to talk rationally to her. So I asked her what she thought was almost as bad. She didn’t want to tell me at first, but then said that I am “flexing on her” with the things I have that she doesn’t. For instance she has a flip phone for safety rather than a smart phone because of the Discord issue. It has approved friends she knows in real life and has met through school of her own age. She said that I am “flexing” having an iPhone, having nice makeup that I only buy on sale, and talking to and having friends. (I only have a few friends, for what it’s worth. I work from home and hardly go out.) I have bought her makeup and things for her hobbies but as an adult on a budget I take care of my items. I’ve had the same iPhone for years, I have an older gaming PC that has had one upgrade and my ps4. She has a switch, a Wii U, and is allowed to use my ps4. When she is bought makeup or figurines etc (she likes anime) she does not take care of them. She leaves her room a mess, steps on them, breaks them etc. and I can’t afford to just re-buy things over and over. I buy her the same kind of shirts I buy myself (hot topic and anime) but she stains them and again, doesn’t take care of them. I buy my pants at the thrift store to afford my shirts and hand wash them to keep the designs nice. I’ve offered to try to help her organize, to teach her to hand wash them etc.

The more I’m typing this out I don’t think I’m being unreasonable. I don’t allow her to have random Discord friends for her own safety because of her maturity level. I do buy her things or offer to let her earn them by helping extra around the house (which she won’t do). She has a chrome book for school but I’m not buying her a gaming PC when I can’t put parental controls on. I couldn’t even afford another right now anyway, money was better then.

TLDR: my daughter says I’m as bad as her abusive dad who is out of the picture because she doesn’t have friends as close or the same items I do. She breaks and doesn’t take care of her stuff so I don’t rebuy it without seeing a change in behavior. Am I in the wrong here? My parents weren’t into technology or anything I was so I never felt jealous or “flexed on” by what they had. Is this normal preteen angst? Anyone else experienced this?"
Parenting,school technology,p8fvch,Too Much Sugar and Screentime?,"I'm a first time mom (31) and my daughter (6) has been in kindergarten for one week. She's my only child so this is all new to me. I feel like the school gives her too much sugar.  She gets juice for breakfast and lunch and on Monday she had a cupcake for a birthday and she tells me the teacher gives her skittles every day for behaving.   I can send her with Lunch and breakfast but they still give her juice.  She already had the starts of cavities in preschool (thanks to me and grandma but we cut that shit out) and I'm worried this will cause more cavities and I'm the one who will end up paying for it, not the school.  

Also I'm concerned that so far all the class has done is play PBS kids games on their tablets (aside from music class, the gym, library). I took my daughters tablet away months ago because it's always a fight with her throwing a tantrum if I put boundaries on it, so I just took it for good.  I didn't know the school would be giving them tablets with games that they can take home and of course she is back to screaming and throwing a fit if I take the tablet (I don't allow technology after dinner). 

Is this normal for public school? When my daughter was in Montessori preschool they focused on hands-on activities that taught the children needed skills.  They also encouraged healthy snacks, no juice, no candy, and definitely no tablets unless the kids were waiting to get picked up. In that case the whole class shared one tablet.  

I should also add that I'm a bit of a helicopter mom...I worry about my kid a lot ( hell, I worry about everything! I have diagnosed mental illness). Am I being crazy here? 

TLDR: Is it normal for public school to give lots of sweets and screentime to students, or am I overthinking this? Do all you other parents not mind sweets and screentime?

Thanks for any advice!"
Parenting,school technology,pqz0uv,iPhone for 8 Year Old Dilemma,"I never thought I would be this parent but  now I am considering getting her an iPhone as my daughter has rapidly increased her out of the house extra curricular activities, meeting a new friend that lives at the end of the street and having sleepovers and other friends houses. 

The reason it really made me think was I get off work at 4:00pm and pick my daughter up from school at 4:15. Well this past week I got stuck in traffic due to an accident  and all I wanted to do was tell her that I'm on my way so she doesn't worry. But when she got in the car I could tell she was a little upset because she was the last child to be picked up. 

She has an iPad already that is pretty heavily restricted as I have screen time limits set where she is not able to log in after certain hours or when she hits a daily maximum. So my question is...what is the difference between the iPad she has and an iPhone? 

The way you are able to restrict these iPhones these days it just seems like it makes more sense. Of course there is the jealousy aspect of me not having something like this as a child, but as technology gets better the world changes also. I have not purchased one yet and I am definitely still in the process of figuring out what to do and would love your input!"
Parenting,school technology,quoact,Internet safety/parental controls,"I’m really awful with technology and I’m overwhelmed trying to figure out parental controls or how to go about internet safety with my kids. (They are 6F and almost 12NB) my oldest has an iPhone which I have “find my friends” active on but they don’t go anywhere without me sans school of course. They also have a laptop with internet and a school iPad. My 6 year old has an iPad that she mainly just watches YouTube or plays games on. 

Having grown up without much technology or internet access I’m worried about just giving them free access to the internet. Worth noting, I’m a single mom with no help (husband passed away nearly 5 years ago) so I’ll admit they get more screen time than I ever originally planned on. My kids have been through a lot…

 **TRIGGER WARNING: death…my husband took his life in our basement, we lost the house so my dad took us in but he recently died too. We also just had to put down our family dog which has been there since my oldest was a baby and now our cat is sick and will likely need to be put down by early next year😔) **

Oldest has become very withdrawn and wants to be in their room 24/7 and I feel uncomfortable not knowing what they’re doing. So I guess my questions are: 1. What resources do you know of that can help me learn and implement internet safety/locks/controls/etc for kids and 2. How do I find a balance of keeping them safe without invading too much of their privacy? The therapist says it’s really important to respect their privacy so I don’t want to read their personal conversations or diary, for example, but want to make sure they’re not up to no good. They’re not allowed on any social media but lately I’ve heard references to tiktok songs or whatnot (I’m not on social media besides Reddit but my BFF is tiktok obsessed so she keeps me informed) so idk if they are maybe sneaking onto it and if so how would I even find that out?!

So if anyone has any resources or guides or suggestions etc I would greatly appreciate it. I would also appreciate any advice on the situation so long as you’re not mean about it, my husbands angelversary is coming up and I’ve been really going through a tough time lately so I just ask no one be rude or unkind please. 

Thanks in advance for any help, I’ll be checking in throughout the day for comments ❤️"
Parenting,school technology,oe0c5p,Stepson (12) is disrespectful and rude! Need help!,"I’ve been married for 5 years (together for 6.5 years). I have one son: 24. My husband has three kids: 17, 15, 12.

My 12 year old stepson (just finished 7th grade), came to live with us 10 months ago. (legally the kids get to decide who to live with at that age).

I’m working from home right now. Husband and kid are both at home from school and work for the summer. So we are all together in the same house constantly.

As time has gone on, my stepson has become more and more disrespectful towards me, and I’m sick of it!

I keep bringing it up to my husband, but he does nothing, and it’s like he doesn’t even care. He just says there’s a lot of truth to the things my stepson says to me. I said, even if there is truth to it, it’s disrespectful to talk to an adult that way. And some things that I find disrespectful, my husband doesn’t think it’s disrespectful.

I have been nothing but nice to this kid since the day I met him. I rarely even see the kid, because I’m always in my bedroom. I even saved up $19,000 two years ago to take husband and all 3 of his kids on a 3 week trip to California. We went to Disneyland, Universal Studios, etc. I let him have sleepovers all the time (his bio mom never let him have one). I’ve taken him to Six Flags, movies, amusement parks, swimming, the drive in, fun places, trampoline places, he has a computer in his room, a PS4, a tv, a tablet, etc. We let him have unlimited technology. I paid for tickets to send husband and kid to see kids favorite basketball team in person. I taught him how to ride a bike. I’ve taken him to do things that he’s never gotten to do before: hockey game, ice skating, roller skating, go carts, painting with a twist, new restaurants, etc). Bio mom never allowed him to eat cereal. I always buy him his favorite cereal. Husband was struggling with paying off his student loans, so I paid them off ($65,000). The kid lives in MY house. I bought him sheets and a comforter in his favorite color when he moved in. I let him decorate his room any way he wanted. I let him get several snakes (snakes are my BIGGEST fear! The snakes eventually died, thank God!). Now he has a fish tank in his room. 

A while back husband and kid sat down to watch a movie. I came in and sat down to watch the beginning of the movie to see if I might be interested in watching it. Kid looked at me and said, “Can you leave? I want to watch a movie alone with my dad.”

Last week kid said to me, “Hey umm... Can you stop turning the house air conditioner up, and leave it where I put it?”

My husband was going out of town the other day for an 8 hour round trip drive. Husband wanted us to go with him. The kid said he wasn’t going to go if I went. And I said I wasn’t going to go if the kid went. Husband asked kid in private why he didn’t want me to go. The kid said I’m a Karen. He said I’m annoying as hell. That I will probably want to stop at Sonic for soda’s 3 times. That I’m annoying cuz I bug husband all day every day. And that I ask husband to do stuff for me constantly. Then as I was walked in the room, I heard kid tell husband that he admits being disrespectful to me, and he’s going to continue being disrespectful to me, and that I deserve it for the way I treat husband. It pissed me off to the point that I got in kids face and yelled at him and cussed him out right in front of my husband. I have never done that before. And I told kid that he was this close to going back to live with his mom (bluffing, cuz husband would never allow that).

Found out yesterday from stepdaughter that stepson is also disrespectful to his bio mom, and to ALL females. And he was so disrespectful to his mom constantly that that’s why she agreed to let him come live with us. She would punish him and ground him, but he would just laugh.

Any advice here? I’m at my wits end!"
Parenting,school technology,pb5vp5,Am I a super helicopter mom?,"My daughter is 10 and this year for school she has to walk 20 minutes from my work to school by herself. She doesn’t have a cell phone (trying to avoid that as long as possible) and I’m scared that she won’t make it to school. I know that by her age I was doing all sorts of activities by myself away from the house for hours, but I feel like kids nowadays are so much “younger” and clueless than we were!! Am I crazy to get a gps tracker to put in her backpack so I know she made it safely? I think if it gives me peace it’s probably worth it… and honestly I think of the technology had been available when we were young my mom would have used it too! Am I just a crazy mom?"
Parenting,school technology,mwhewt,How much technology time are other teenagers getting?,"My almost 14 year old son, our oldest of 3 boys, is convinced that my wife and I are being unreasonably controlling about his computer and technology time. We have intentionally limited our kids use of television to only weekends, which includes switch and Xbox. They will get a movie during school nights every so often. 

He has an iPhone that turns on at 7:15 am and shuts off at 9:30 pm. Apple Screen Time is a joke of a software, but it does shut down apps at the time it’s supposed to. He also does not have safari or any browser on his phone. (Not that he can’t get to a browser otherwise, ie screen time sucks and you can open safari through gmail app). He also uses a laptop for homework, to voice chat on discord and will sometimes be allowed to play Minecraft after his homework is done. 

I feel like the limitations we’ve put on technology are reasonable for a 14 year old. But I would love to hear how other parents have limited their teenagers use of tech and what they think of our process.

Update:

Thank you to those who provided constructive help for us. We needed to hear how others are handling this issue. We are parents who are working hard on creative ways to help our children grow up in this new environment of the digital age. Many of you have head great empathy for us and I Iearned some things. 

For those who insist on the gatekeeping and use parent shaming. Please think about your approach to helping other parents who are asking for help. Many of you shamed me because you believe that we are ludites and acting like we are locking our children in their bedroom whenever they have free time. 

1. Parenting is not an exact science. Please don’t talk in definitives. 

2. Parenting is hard. Please speak encouraging words not shaming words. 

3. Parenting is the responsibility of those who are the caretakers of those kids. Every child is different. Just because you’ve seen something that works or doesn’t work for one child, doesn’t mean that result will be the same for another."
Parenting,school technology,ouyus9,Would you put off your last year of school to stay home with 2nd kid?,"I am married with a 3 year old at home and am due with #2 in November. I work full time, mainly remotely since Covid, but will likely need to go back to some in-person days after maternity leave is over (I’ll get about 14 weeks). My husband is a full time student in radiologic technology, he doesn’t work but his school is more than full-time, he has about 30 hours a week of placement at a hospital plus classes and homework. It’s a 2 year program and year 2 starts in September.

So I get a few months maternity leave, but it will just be me with both kids most of the time while husband’s in school. My mom lives nearby and will help some, and 3 year old will start nursery school in January (Covid allowing) but that’s only 2 days a week for 3 hour blocks. We will not be doing daycare for either, it is scarce right now and does not make financial sense.

After mat leave I will be somehow working full time again while husband is still in school and as mentioned previously, no daycare. And we currently share a car. We will ask my mother for more help but it would be part time at best. My job is pretty understanding about remote work, but I still have to get my work done with 2 kids, by myself a lot of time. My job is key since I support the family financially and provide our health insurance.

We’ve started to entertain the idea of husband taking a year off from school so he can just be home with me and we can be a team with childcare and I can get work done and go in when needed. However, he’s 35 and wants to get going with his career here in the US (he is an immigrant and qualifications didn’t translate hence the going back to school). He is also doing very well in his program and already had a job offer for when he finishes that would include tuition reimbursement for his whole program, but that is for May ‘22 when he’s currently meant to graduate. 

So do we somehow figure out this sucky year and get through it? Once he’s working we could afford a 2nd car and daycare. So the biggest struggle would be end of mat leave through qualification, about 4-5 months. But maybe it’s worth it to have him home for baby #2’s first year? Neither of us know the best answer. Looking for advice from parents of 2. And sorry this was so long."
Parenting,school technology,pnku6i,Need advice with my tween son,"I'm beside myself right now and really not sure how to deal with this when he gets home.  I just found out that my son has been using one of my credit cards to buy things on amazon without asking.  he went as far as taking the physical card and creating a separate email and amazon account to hide this.  I discovered all of this after he went to school.  Going through this new email address it looks like he has ordered many other things as well from amazon that didn't show up on my card.  As far as i can tell he did not use any of my other cards but now I'm concerned he got someone else's credit card number and was using that!  Amazon cancelled a lot of the orders but it does look like several did go through.  I've already pulled his computer as well as phone and plan on no technology for the foreseeable future.  In the past he has said things about running away or hurting himself but neither of these have ever happened and have only come out during tough situations like this so we think this is just a way to get a rise out of us or to lessen his punishment.  Obviously this is a dangerous road he is on and i need to nip it in the bud now before it gets worse.  

When I talk to him this afternoon i was planning on staying as calm as possible but expressing my disappointment and breach of trust.  I know from when I was a kid going at them angry never helps though i am absolutely livid. Not that it is an excuse for him by any means but I really think this started with the whole fortnight v-bucks obsession and his desire to ""keep up with the joneses"" with his friends.  

&#x200B;

I'm hoping someone has dealt with something like this and has some advice."
Parenting,school technology,ob7wcn,The role of technology for children,"Full disclosure of my personal bias on this topic: I am an IT guy for a school system so educational technology is kinda my job. I am also 26 so I grew up on technology since probably the Playstation1 and Gameboy color. Should we reevaluate the negative outlook for kids using tablets and computers and ""screen time"" at a young age? My son is 4 and for his 4th birthday I got him an Amazon kids tablet and installed all the educational apps we install on our Pre K and Kindergarten iPads they use for centers. We use technology for teaching almost if not everyday. We just went virtual this past school year because of COVID and everything they did was online for about half the year. The kids who were the most behind were the kids who just wanted to skip all their core classes and just play in the AG shop all day. Kids who didn't have a computer at home to be familiar with. 

Technology is now slowing down folks and is certainly not reversing. If kids don't keep up and are proficient with technology the world will leave them behind.  I have heard here and there about how bad tablets and computers are for kids but I am unsure about the metric being used to describe them as ""bad."" What say ye? Is technology still the devil as it was suggested my whole childhood or is it a necessity in the world we live in today?"
Parenting,school technology,oxl4hb,what to do?,"my 16 year old son is adamantly refusing to attend school. he insists that he wants to be a ""NEET"" (not in employment, education, or training) and has no need for an education or job. we have tried to use positive and negative reinforcement with him (rewarding him for cooperation and confiscating electronics when he misbehaves) but he doesn't seem to give a shit about anything. after being technologically deprived, he will proceed to lie in bed for the entire day, staring at the ceiling. 

for context, he has major depressive disorder and is seeing a therapist and on meds. we have asked him what he wants to do in the future - what interests he wants to pursue - and his answer is always ""nothing."" he has no zest for life whatsoever. 

it wasn't always this way. he used to be an avid artist and pianist, as well as a straight A student. this year, he has fallen into a debilitating downward spiral and has quit all his former activities. he threatens that he will run away from home if we enroll him into school this year. 

we're not certain what caused his sudden abhorrence for school, but we're guessing it stemmed from his psych ward stay in april. he'd been in inpatient care for a week due to suicidal ideation. as a result, he missed a chunk of school and fell behind on assignments. this hit him hard, and he decided to give up altogether on academics. 

we have no idea what to do with him. in our state, it is against the law to drop out of school before the age of 18. it's a week before enrollment day, and we have yet to get him on board with attending school."
Parenting,school technology,lobi4i,Do you use/plan on giving your child a smart phone or ipad before age 10,"Not including for school work. I find it's becoming less and less popular to limit use of technology. I plan on doing as little screen time as possible in general until they're at least 10. I saw in a facebook group a poll was done and a majority voted no phone or tablet before age ten. But I wonder if that's the general consensus. Not sure why it needs clarification, but yes i am a parent"
Parenting,school technology,om9alw,"15 year old addicted to phone, poor sleep","At what age did you all allow teens to regulate their own sleep as far as technology goes?   

My 15 year old step daughter has had a smart phone since she was 12, but she’s always had to leave it downstairs after 10pm or so.   We’ve relaxed on ensuring it’s downstairs the past 6 months, but we’ve also noticed that she’s been staying up until 3 or 4 am or so to chat with her boyfriend.  She barely looks up from her phone all day the forces herself to stay up all night as well.   Her interest in anything but her phone and the boy has all but vanished.  

At 15 should we intervene more forcefully?  We talked to her about turning it in at 11pm, but that night she snuck it to her room until 3am anyway.   Once school restarts next month and she has to get up at 6:30am again there’s no way this will work.   We don’t want her to fail school and ruin her GPA for some boy who we know won’t last forever.   Her father hates all these new changes.  

Let her make mistakes or remotely shut her phone down?   What do you all think?  

** side note I’m not the disciplinarian or rule maker.  I’m only supporting her father and his wishes."
Parenting,school technology,pbs1kn,Does band/orchestra/chorus replace other specials in your child’s schedule? Which ones?,"And are they also pulled from their other classes for weekly lessons? Just curious how other school districts do this. For ours, students (middle school) who are in band/orchestra/chorus miss out on three specials that rotate throughout the year - media arts, computers/technology, and engineering. They are also pulled weekly from regular classes for small group lessons. Daily PE is mandatory so that is the one class they cannot be pulled from even though my kid is very active so it’s the one class I prefer he miss. 

I also recall it being this way when I was a kid…I think I missed cooking/sewing (gosh I’m old) woodworking and “computers” lol. Was it the same when you were growing up if you chose music? What did *you* miss? Thanks!"
Parenting,school technology,nh2a75,Virtual Schooling rant,"Rounding out a year of virtual schooling my kids through elementary school. The teachers have had to work way harder and put up with way more, but I'm just UGH! Can I at least get an ""assistant teacher training certificate"" out of this or something. Glad my kids got to dodge covid so far. Glad all technology and school system and teachers exist to make this even an option. BUT ARRRRGGGHHHH!!!!"
Parenting,school technology,nbq2tp,I (31f) Found Kids(13nb) Secret Social Medias and Inappropriate conversations,"Hi all! Please help :) I don't have anyone to go for for advice. Also, my child is non-binary, and goes by they/them, just fyi. 

Let me preface this by saying I am a 31 year old, single mom to a 13 year old kid. I grew up with in a strict household with no boundaries (no privacy, very little leniency, etc), which lead to a poor relationship with my mother as an adult. I am trying to parent my child differently so I may break that cycle. I am more lenient and open minded and have very open communication.  My rules for my child are: they can have a tiktok, instagram, and youtube account, but are not allowed to post and have to keep age appropriate settings for what they view. They can use discord, and other communication apps like that. They are allowed to play appropriate video games with their friends (minecraft, fortnite, among us, etc) after they have finished school work. I am technologically adept (Im a PC gamer, I use discord/tiktok/insta/etc) so I understand how they all work. We have boundaries, as in I do not snoop through their stuff and trust that they will behave appropriately, but I have had many talks with them about online safety and all that. 

SO NOW TO THE POINT

Today I asked to see what my childs tiktok name was so I could send them a cute video. They panicked and started acting very suspicious. They wouldn't give me the phone, admitting to having a secret second account. This lead to a tumble down the rabbit hole. After trust had been broken, I took their phone and then started looking through other apps. They have a secret tiktok, insta, snapchat, and discord. They tried to secretly log out of all of these from their laptop, thinking I wouldn't figure that out. They had been posting to their insta/tiktok/snap accounts, nothing bad, but thats besides the point. Their usernames on all the secret accounts are very inappropriate, using the words whore and slut. I didn't read too many of the discord messages, I don't want to break every boundary, but from what I did see, it includes very inappropriate, MATURE conversations and words. Now understand, I am not naive. I know kids are curious and want to act ""cool"", so I am not 100% surprised by this, but I am upset about the secrecy and lying. 

What I need advice on:

\- What do you guys think would be an appropriate way to approach this and what consequences would suffice, with out ruining the relationship we have built? I am leaning towards taking away their technology for a bit, and then after that set new rules for their social medias, but what those rules would be, idk. I am not trying to be the ""cool"" mom, but I know my options are to either cut them off from all of it somehow, break boundaries and monitor everything they do (which may make things worse), or allow them to post and what not, but I have to ok it before they post it. My main reasoning for not allowing posting is to avoid predators, but if I can ok what they post first, then I would be open to it. Ah idk. Like I said, Im not naive. They are going to do things I don't want them to do, but I want them to be safe about it!!!

\- What do I do about the inappropriate conversations they have with their friends? Im not sure there IS anything I can do other than going full crazy mode and ban them from everything, but that will hurt more than help, I feel. Kids are kids. They need to experiment and such, and I get that. But idk, it's just so inappropriate for a 13 year old. 

I just need some help, man. How do you raise a teenager, especially in a time of endless technology and social medias, to be safe and honest and aware?! Sorry for the rant. It all just happened and I am trying to figure it out and process it all before blowing up on them. THANK YOU!

**TL;DR** Child is not allowed to post on social media but I found out about secret social media accounts across all platforms, where they post regularly. Also saw very inappropriate convos with their friends. How do I handle this without breaking boundaries?"
Parenting,school technology,nyhyn9,How should we address the bad habit of stealing ?,"Hello peoples !

I (29f)have a 10-year-old son we will call him Daniel. Daniels Dad and I are not together but we coparents. It isn’t always the best but I would say that eight times out of 10 it is. Daniel is a smart boy. Has a lot of friends and lives a comfortable life. 

A couple weeks ago I picked up Daniel from school. When he got into my car he had three dollars with him, I asked where did you get three dollars from, he said my friend Elijah give it to me for joining his club.

I asked at the club was about and he Could not give me much information just that a lot of kids joined and he had promised to give them all money. While I thought this was odd I didn’t think too much into it. He’s never really lied to me.

He mentioned that Elijah would be giving him money again( I feel like this is where the lies were already starting). 
I believed him I didn’t say anything. He asked me if I could take him to the gas station to buy chips I said no because I really needed to use the restroom.

The next day I picked him up from school again and I recalled him telling me Elijah would give him money again so I asked him if he did. 
He said no but then changed his mind and said yes that Elijah gave him three more dollars. He asked me if I could take him to the gas station I said I would.

He then asked me if we could go to the house to get the other three dollars because he wanted to buy more stuff at the gas station. I said no but if he wanted we could go to the gas station when I took him to his grandma‘s house for the weekend. (Daniel is not seeing his dad at this time they had a falling out and had not been hanging out for a couple months, so instead of his dads on the weekends he went with his dads mom).

Daniel decline the offer he said he just go to the gas station now. I said OK. We go to the gas station and as soon as I park he bolts out of the car. I thought He was just so excited to get his chips. I was putting gas as he came back. I noticed he had a brown paper bag and he pulled out a bag of chips and said here these are for you so you don’t steal mine.

I said oh thanks but we can share and I looked down at his hands and I noticed that along with a receipt he had a ten of five and a couple of ones. I said Daniel where did you get that money from? He said oh I told you Elijah gave it to me. She said Elijah actually gave me $23. I said are you sure?

I kept asking on the way home if he was sure where he got the money from and I asked him if we called Elijah’s parents that they would confirm that they gave him money. He swore up and down that they would and that  Elijah gave him the money.
 I was in the kitchen when he brought me the phone and called his parents they did not answer.

My sister called and I was explaining to her the story as I was cleaning my kitchen. I noticed on my counter some cash I left the night before. I picked up the cash and counted and of course I was short money. I went to Daniel‘s room and long story short he confessed that he took money from me.

My initial reaction wasn’t the best I raise my voice I was emotional and very upset. I could not fathom a 10 year old stealing for me. I did not cancel him going to his grandma’s house because of some family event they were going to. I did talk to her to explain the situation and what my rules were. I decided that I would talk to him when he came back home when I was more levelheaded but I did apologize to him before I dropped him off and told him we would have a better conversation when he came back.

He decided to leave with his dad that weekend who he hasn’t seen in a couple months and I knew it was because he wanted to avoid me. I talk to his dad about it and he agreed he was wrong but he wanted to spend time with him and said that we could talk to him together and I agreed to that.

Later that day my mom calls me and asked me if she could come see me and Daniel I told her Daniel was at his dads house and she asked if I made him go there or if he wanted to go and I told her he wanted to go because he was trying to avoid me and told her what happened.

She said oh my goodness and then she asked me not to be mad at her but she said the last time that he went to her house which was months ago she asked her and my brother if they could buy him a video game they said no. The next day my brother had A charge on his credit card for sad video game. I was very disappointed to say the least.

I talk to his dad about it he was also very disappointed we are a little shocked.We have not spoken to him yet about it because we are not exactly sure how to go about the situation.

He stole from me knowing it was wrong but also having done it before. I considered asking if he needed the money for anything else may be a bully at school? But it has become clear he wants money for games and chips.

I thought about having a conversation about morals and values ethics and trust. We’ve acknowledge we are not going to give him as much freedom with technology. I just really want to get through to him and make him understand that what he has done it’s not OK.

He knows the consequences an adult would face. I don’t want to be too hard on him but I want to make sure that the conversation his dad and I have with him is efficient… any advice ?"
Parenting,school technology,n1qq4d,"Taking away ""social time"" for an autistic child","My daughter Bri (14) was diagnosed with high functioning autism about 2 years ago. We didn't have much time to ""deal"" with it - before the pandemic started. The psychologist we were referred to after diagnosing didn't get to spend much time with us, talking about parenting strategies, etc. She was more focused on my daughter and how she was handling it. 

Now - Bri is defiant, stubborn, etc. There are 2 things that work for her, spanking (which she's obviously too old for now - and is NOT the focus of this post) and complete grounding. Extra chores, no technology etc. This is the focus of this post.

Bri has struggled with making friends - and we've had quite a few instances of turning up to events onto to find Bri was intentionally given wrong dates/times/places to ""placate"" the ""invite everybody rule"" or shown up to moans and groans about the ""loser"" showing up. Because of all this - we switched her schools this year to a new school. 

Two things have happened since then. Bri has been more defiant and more stubborn - but she's also began being invited to things regularly. I'm however unable to tell if these invitations are a joke or genuine as I have not met these kids as Bri has unfortunately been grounded the last 4 times she's been invited to something. I haven't wanted to undermine myself as she WILL pick up on that to get out of punishment in the future. 

I FINALLY had a meeting with Bri's psychologist today where she went off at me for ""socially neglecting my child"". Apparently Bri has been saying how horrible she feels about missing out and that she feels I am ""abusing"" her by refusing to allow her the chance to socialise as ""autistic people need to learn to do this"". Psychologist says I need to find an alternate way to punish Bri - but can't offer anything as she ""understands"" that Bri is strong willed, defiant, stubborn and will simply ignore other punishment. Apparently anything but ""depriving"" Bri is acceptable. Apparently I shouldn't even take Bri's phone when she is grounded. 

When I asked her about how to be sure if these are genuine invitations or jokes - the psychologist said that wasn't a ""reason"" to hold back and it was Bri's responsibility to know the difference... She literally cannot tell the difference. 

So - my two questions are, am I abusing Bri by taking away her opportunity for social contact and if so - how do I discipline her effectively? I don't feel like I am and I feel  like Bri is manipulating the psychologist to get what she wants.  And secondly how do I teach Bri to tell the difference between her being genuinely liked or being a ""joke"" to her peers?"
Parenting,school technology,80l4ap,I'm no longer Will. I am Uncle Phil.,"I was born to a drug dealer in 1980 and my mom found the courage to leave him him when I was 5. It wasn't a swift transition and involved the kidnapping of my little sister and a police standoff. It wasn't until I had gone through foster homes and a year living with my aunt and uncle that my mom got me back. Life was tumultuous to say the least until I was 8 and an AA meeting commercial was on T.V. They went around a circle stating their names followed with ""and I'm an alcoholic"" that I turned to her and said ""that's what you are"".

That was the day my mom got sober. Within a year I had a dad and I was no longer the man of the house. That's a tough transition for a boy who was used to taking care of his mom and his sister, but it was a relief to get to be a kid. I did't do so well with the transition though.

By 13 I was such a problem child that my parents kicked me out of the house. I went to live my friend and his dad, who didn't seem to mind because he was too buys dealing drugs to really notice I was there until we did something wrong and got caught for it, and he beat our ass. Not for being delinquents, but for being caught.

My dad (step dad, the only dad I had known) got wind of the abuse and picked me up. Things were alright, but I met a girl who had an equally disturbing childhood, if not worse. Within the year I had got her pregnant and not knowing how to be a man, I ran. I moved out of state to live with another aunt and uncle.

That was an amazing year. For a brief moment I was surround by family who believed in me. I was a straight-A student who was miles away from my real life. Until a call one day. ""You had a daughter last night"". It was my mom. I told her no I don't and I hung up.

Three weeks later, the guilt got to me and I moved home. I knew I had to do the right thing but I didn't know how. The next several years were me being selfish, almost to the point of sociopathy. All I cared about was my instant gratitude. Whatever made me happy that instant, that was me. Booze, drugs, girls, you name it.

Eventually I had fucked up so much that my only out was to move back in with my baby momma. I pretended to be a good person and before I knew it I was married and 20 years old. My daughter knew her father, but I was a bad father. I was angry, I was short-tempered, and I was trapped in a situation that I didn't want. I didn't do this to myself, someone did this to me.

A man with no reason to look after me took a liking to me and taught me what it was like to be a man. His name was Marv. I didn't understand why he was the way he was, but I knew that people liked him and I liked that. I wanted to be him. He became my dad.

My wife got pregnant and I had a son in 2004. I don't know when it happened, but at some point I stopped pretending to be a good person and I started **being** a good person. One night, in late 2004, I was carrying my son around the house at 2am because he would cry if he was still. I had gone from a low-life welfare kid thinking my only option was the life my parents promised me, to making 6 figured at 24 because I finally found something I was good at: technology.

That night when I was carrying my son, Fresh Prince was on. It was the ""[why don't he want me man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMNsMdnSBIk)"" episode. I sat there at 2am, holding my son while my wife and my daughter slept, crying like a child. I cried for what seemed like hours. My son fell asleep, I laid down with him on the couch and went to sleep. I never spoke of it.

A few days later I was taking a shower and broke down completely. I don't remember crying, or even _feeling_ before that. My wife walked into the bathroom and I let it all out. I cried for a week, sporadically. I couldn't get my shit under control. Every time I saw my son, all I could think was ""how could he not want me?"". I wasn't there for my daughter's birth and I never felt that connection with her. It's been almost 14 years since that week and I still struggle with my inability to be a good father to her.

But that moment never left me. Any time I saw that episode, I lost it. I started watching episodes of television that touched me like that when my family went to bed. The finale of SCRUBS when J.D. imagined his perfect life. The episode of Roseanne when Dan finds out ~~Booker~~ Fisher beat Jackie. All these moments where men were men and they were allowed to feel.

Then in 2011, Marv died. My 3rd child, my 2nd son, had just been born. I was the man I always wanted to be but never thought I would become. I was alone though, I didn't know how to exist without my mentor and while I was the rock for my family who missed their grandpa, I was a wreck when everyone went to bed. I would drink by myself and by morning, nobody would know.

My oldest son is 14 now. He's an amazing person. I am in awe of everything he is and it's humbling to think I am his father. I was a poor kid. I was on welfare, my family had no money, the only reason I could play sports was because the school or the lions club supported me. My son doesn't see himself as a rich kid, and he related to my stories as a child. His junior high-school years should, by all rights, be filled with impressing kids with his house and flaunting my financial status. But he doesn't. He collects misfits. His friends are the kids who were like me when I was a kid. Kids with families who don't care about them. Kids who otherwise would think that once High-school is over, they'll be working dead-end jobs.

It dawned on me last week when my wife and I were talking that all his friends call us ""mom"" and ""dad"". We are the confidants that they have. We are the safe place that they come after school and on the weekends to feel respected, and loved, and encouraged. We're the reason that they're discussing college and their SATs in grade 8. We're the ones giving them home that there is life beyond their current situation. We're the ones they will look to when they think about their future.

I had a rough week and decided to have a drink after everyone went to bed. Old habits die hard and I pulled up that trusty old Fresh Prince episode and while I teared up as always, this time it was different. This time I realized that I wasn't the wounded child who didn't understand why my father didn't want me. This time it was because I was the man that these lost children looked up to.

I first saw that episode in 2004 when I was 24 years old. Tonight I am 37 and I have moved beyond that broken child wondering why he was abandoned. I am no longer the lost child and am now a guiding light (or at least, trying to be) for lost children.

Tonight is a victory for me, but not because I made myself better. Tonight is a victory for my children who made me a better man, and had the wisdom to share that with other broken toys.

Tonight I am no longer Will. Tonight, I am Uncle Phil.

**Edit:** There are a lot of comments wondering ""what about your daughter?"" so I figured I'd consolidate those responses here:

My daughter just turned 22. By comparison to my parents, I was an amazing father to her. By comparison to the father my sons have had, I was a pathetic father if not downright awful. I spent the first third of her childhood showing her how selfish I was, the next third thinking I could fill that void with things instead of love and compassion, and the last third fighting with her for turning into me.

The reason I don't talk about how proud I am of her is that when I look at her, what I see is me before I learned how to look in the mirror. She is a carbon copy of who I was, and I'm not proud of who I was.

I want to stress that I am making this sound worse than the reality because I want to be honest about how I feel. My daughter grew up safe and loved and a lot of her childhood was truly magical when I look back on it. But I wasn't the father that she deserved, and I didn't want to pretend that was the case here.

We have a relationship, but she's 22 and self-important. She doesn't have a lot of time for us, and that lends itself to a slow process of rebuilding a relationship and figuring out how to be a good father to her. She hasn't hit that point where she realizes how fragile life is and she assumes I'll be here when she's ready to rebuild and for now, I have to be okay with that. I have no right to demand a relationship with her, so I reach out and wait for her reach back."
Parenting,school technology,f1ra4w,Advice needed: 8 yr old son who does not wipe,"I  have a stubborn 8 years old son who does not wipe his butt. I know he doesn't do it or do a good job because he is rushing to play with his friends, he is scared of being in the bathroom alone, and/or he is lazy. There are rare occasions he does an okay job at wiping and we praise him for it. BUT I'd say 85% of the time, it is a battle. One positive is he ALWAYS flushes. 

Things I have tried to improve this poor habit:

I  have lectured him on the importance of proper hygiene. I have explained  (multiple times) the seriousness of pink eye! I have also pointed out  the social issue when it comes to friends and the slippery slope of  bullying, ""you don't want kids at school to smell you, kids can be mean  and start calling you names."" These do not phase my kid.

My boyfriend and I have had to stand and watch him wipe. When we stand there, he will do it right, but we don't want to make this a habit.

He has had time outs, technology taken away, gone to bed early, and we've had him clean his room/messes throughout the house. Still does not phase him.

My next option is making him hand wash the worst pairs of his underwear. When he finishes, I hope to create an open conversation with him and let him help come out with ideas that he thinks how he can do to be better with wiping. If that does not work, I am at my wits end! I am sure I am not the only parent out there that has experienced this issue. If anyone else has suggestions on how to get an 8-year-old boy to PROPERLY wipe, I am open to suggestions. how to get an 8-year-old boy to PROPERLY wipe, I am open to suggestions."
Parenting,school technology,pg0476,"Parenting 12-18 yo's - Devices, The Internets, Supervision, and Parental Controls","Looking for guidance and advice from the wise ones that have gone before me:

My older kid is starting 7th grade, and COVID stuff over the past while has meant they had more access to technology and the internet than they probably would have otherwise. 

Play dates turned into playing video games together online, or talking on FaceTime or Zoom. Talking on the playground turned into texting with iMessage. Lots of TV, probably too much free time on YouTube, I'm guessing most of you know the deal. 

As we go back to school, we're looking to get more clear and formalize some structures around what we allow and how we track it. Right now he has access to an iPhone, and iPad, and a MacBook, as well as a Roku TV, a PlayStation, and a Nintendo Switch. 

The phone is an old one we set up mostly for him to listen to music on (via a family Spotify plan) but he also uses iMessage / FaceTime to talk with friends and family. We do use Apple parental controls but they are confusing and not perfect, and he knows we can/will take the phone and look through it sometimes. We've mostly kept both Safari (web browsing) and YouTube disabled on this phone, but sometimes friends will send links to things that he can play, or send screen capture videos of cool TikToks or memes or whatever. 

The iPad is mostly for tablet games and drawing / art programs. This one has a password lock on the Home Screen, and it's logged into parent iCloud accounts, not his personal one. We have to unlock it for him to use it, but we don't track or supervise every detail here. He likes to watch YouTube videos on weekend mornings while his little sibling watches TV shows. 

The MacBook is a new development, replacing a Chromebook for school use with a cheap Mac that can do all the same stuff, but keeps him in the Apple eco-system, which is where most of the family devices are. We're still getting this set up and parental controls on the laptop vs the phone feel a bit confusing. 

The TV is what it is, it's on the living room wall so he doesn't get a ton of time where he can access it and not have other people see what he's doing. We have parental control locks on some of the channels (like he can't get to adult shows on Netflix) but the big picture of how this works means that he can range pretty freely here when he's home alone. 

The two gaming systems are pretty locked down, with parental controls apps that restrict play, and restrict online interaction somewhat. I don't think I understand how all the details work as well as I'd like but in general, he only gets time on these when I unlock them for him. 

All in all, I feel super confused as a parent in terms of what to allow and how strict to be, and even more confused about how to manage and limit what he sees and does. But I know there is a lot of stuff on the internet - both in the porn realm and in the shitty human behavior realm and in the conspiracy / mens rights activism / incel / white supremacist / etc realm that I don't love him wandering the wilds of the WWW on his own. But I also know that it's where his schoolwork lives, his friends hang out, and where he learns about artists and musicians and styles and events he likes so.. 

I'd love to hear any stories or advice about both the details - like what sort of limitations or software controls you have in place, and what agreements or expectations you set with kids - and the bigger picture - like how do we teach our kids to navigate this stuff in a healthy way."
Parenting,school technology,ig89k7,Caught my 3 year old doing something incredible surprising today.,"I should preface this, I'm a huge computer nerd. My career is in IT and I'm basically addicted to computers, software, hardware, gaming, tech articles, typing, etc.  Huge nerd, that's me.

We have 3 daughters and our youngest is 3 years old.  Today I honestly can't really believe what I caught her doing.

I walked out of the kitchen and into the living room just after breakfast to find her playing on our microsoft surface computer on one of the learning games we have.  She was sitting there doing one of the typing games.  She had all of her fingers on the correct keys on the keyboard and was actually typing the keys using the correct fingers when prompted to type certain letters or symbols (i.e. using left pinky for the 'a' key and the right index for the 'j' key, etc).

She was SUPER proud and she was just cruising through the typing exercises, basically getting them all correct over and over again.  She's 3 years old....

When I was a student in junior high school my class/year was the very first class to have a required keyboarding class and I remember learning to type.  Today I type over 100wpm with zero errors.  So seeing her there typing was a really interesting moment for me.

I mean, I've watched all 3 of our daughters become far more proficient at using a variety of technology at a far younger age than I did (computers, smartphones, touch screens, etc), but seeing our 3 year old typing correctly, using the correct fingers on the correct keys, without anyone sitting there coaching her was kind of a jaw dropping moment for me."
Parenting,school technology,kz2hyq,Am I wrong for limiting my 12 yr old sons technology use? ...a lot,"I wanted to ask the “world” about what they think about me barely allowing my 7th grader to use technology.  Originally I bought him an iPhone 5 when he was 9 for Christmas.  I thought it would be useful to have while walking a short distance home from school...& it was.  I thought “all the kids have it so maybe, I guess, I’ll buy him One.  Very quickly it was obvious that he wasn’t ready for one.  A lot of disregard for the care of it, playing games all day on it (not the reason I bought it), and not using it to call me when he was away from me.  I switched his device over to a watch, then eventually gave him the phone back by age 11.  I had strict restrictions on it, he could only use it for 1-3hrs give or take a day. That included limited text, His internet is blocked aside from school websites, games have a time limit, and calls are restricted to only me and my gf when it’s “downtime.”  A month Or two ago all of the restrictions came off aside from the blockage of internet.  I don’t know how exactly it came off but I kinda left it be because I thought maybe the kid needs more time to talk and text people during this isolated year.  He never had a close friend so he was never demanding or eager to get more phone time really, he just accepted the rules and abided by them without complaining.  When covid started I allowed him to play video games & I had never allowed that in the past.  When he was younger like 5/6 his baby sitter used to let him play but it was against my rules and it was never at home.  Around august he lost his privileges to that by playing when I had told him it was not allowed.  So he played for about 4 months straight.  As most of us know, the pandemic has our kids doing school online.  He already spends 6-9hrs on the computer a day for school and studying so I feel he doesn’t really to stare at a screen much longer anyway.  A couple months ago I caught him looking up girls on YouTube so I blocked inappropriate sites but I noticed that he goes on incognito and does things on the computer anyway.  I know it’s normal. I told him it wasn’t appropriate and I do not like that happening on My computer.  I do let him watch tv.  Him and I watch a movie together multiple nights a week and sometimes he watches it on his own tv shows on his own without me.  He also has adhd so the doctor told me in general to limit his screen time, just to add that in here.  Anyways, if your wondering what does he do for fun or in his spare time, he’s a very active kid and physical activity takes up most of his time.  He used to be on a hockey team but that has fallen short, so now we go to open skate 4x a week.  He does an exercise routine twice a day, he takes times in his day to read, does his chores, plays with legos, and practices piano or guitar. Sometimes he will watch tv and be on the phone, or we’ll watch tv together or he’ll help me cook. At night I have him put his phone on the kitchen table near mY room.  —anyways, I recently noticed that he’s been on his phone during school, and that he’s been sneaking it in his bed every night. I walked in his room and decided to take it away. I decided he was grounded.  I honestly don’t want to give it back to him because the reason I gave it in the first place was so he could contact me when we’re not together.  We’re always together now, he doesn’t go anywhere, I barely do either.  My views are that many kids are addicted to the internet and I just don’t want my kids getting sucked into the into it all.  My question here is- am I a bitch for wanting to limit this so much and for taking the phone away? I want to only give it back to him when he goes back to school in person. I know he can still see his friends during school hours so I just don’t care anymore.  He can also see friends at open skate and his cousin comes over every other weekend. I don’t mind taking him outside more. I’m just wondering- does ANYONE else limit their kids screen time or take away the phone? Or not even give the 12 yr old the phone at all? Amongst my friends with kids- I’m the only one! Why??? Is it that uncommon??? Am I a bad mom?!"
Parenting,school technology,iov7yd,I'm worried for the children who NEED to physically be in school. Advice?,"I'm not trying to start a political debate or anything like that. Just looking for advice specifically from parents on this topic.

To make a long story short I grew up depending on going to school for lunch. I also heavily relied on talking to my guidance counselor and trusted teachers about things I couldn't talk about at home. As I got older I relied on the support from my friends for the same reasons. 

In elementary school I remember teachers buying winter coats for kids who didn't have one and I also remember a teacher buying a child a pair of shoes because his were falling apart. 

I'm so worried for these children and what is going to happen to them during this time. I know that the point of virtual learning is to keep everyone safe but what about when home isn't a safe place?

Who is watching these children while they learn virtually? Some grandparents are going to have a very hard time helping children learn virtually due to their limited knowledge of technology. Are these children even going to learn anything? What happens when they do go back to school? Are the children who didn't have an ideal learning environment going to fall behind their peers?

It all just makes me so sad and it doesn't feel like my local school system is doing anything at all about any of this. They are providing free meals, but they must be picked up. But every year local churches and schools do coat drives and school supply drives. Yet some student still don't have a coat or supplies. If parents can't go pick up those things how can anyone be sure that they will go pick up food and actually give it to their children?

As a parent myself it hurts me even more because I can't understand how our school systems are literally failing students in my opinion. I know everything is new and schools are ""trying their best"" to figure everything out. I also know that there are AMAZING teachers who are doing every single thing they can and then some to help these kids out. But unfortunately it's not enough of those teachers and not enough support from the school district itself. 

I struggled severely with undiagnosed anxiety, depression, and mild aspergers growing up. I was ridiculed, punished, yelled at, and humiliated during high school due to my issues. I felt like the entire school was trying their absolute best to make my time there as miserable as possible. I had a teacher literally ask me if I was stupid because he asked me a question I didn't know the answer to and I kept saying ""um"" because my brain couldn't think of what to say. It was honestly heartbreaking for me to have him ask me that in front of the entire class. When I tried to talk to the guidance counselor about it she brushed it off and made it seem like he was just joking. 

I didn't realize it as a kid but now as an adult and a parent it makes me so angry that not a single person in that school cared enough about me to notice that I was different and that I wasn't okay. No one took the time to get to know me and find out what was going on. That school 100% failed me. It got to the point where I hated going so much I just quit about seven months before graduation. I had just turned 17 so I was still technically a child. I didn't do any school work past that point. No one reached out. No one said anything. No one sent me work to do at home. I just got my diploma in the mail a few weeks before graduation because my mom called to see if I was graduating or what I needed to do to get my GED. 

No one cared. And if that can happen to me who went to school everyday and walked the halls with these people then it will 100% happen to kids who are sitting at home behind a small square on a computer screen. 

What about the children who are being abused? Who is going to see the marks? Who is going to see the boys ribs when his shirt accidentally lifts because he's so hungry? 

It just makes me so angry and sad. Does anyone have any advice or input? Is anyone's local school district doing anything to help with anything I've mentioned?

Thank you"
Parenting,school technology,p2isq8,Keep going or quit?,"The large public school district my kids attend offered free camps this summer through various organizations, one of which has a reputation as an excellent technology educator, for coding, robotics, app creation, etc. The cost to attend that provider's classes, as extracurricular activities  is high and the camps are free. My son, age 13, attended one for ages 12 and up, it was robotics and programming the robots they built, was 4 hours duration during weekday afternoons for one week a month ago. This week, my husband enrolled son and our daughter, age 10, into the same provider's drone coding and flying class. This one is a full day, 9-5. We do not need to have them attend for child care purposes.  Our kids have said that the reality at this camp is that a lot of the time is wasted, they made a last minute decision to include younger kids around age 7, they have spent a lot of time waiting around for drone batteries to charge, or getting the younger kids to pay attention and while the staff is knowledgeable and encouraging, my kids feel like they would rather not attend the rest of the week. 

Daughter is the only female camper and said she felt a bit awkward. 

13yo offered to do more household chores instead, (in addition to his regular chores) which I really appreciate, because the house needs some extra cleaning attention, we are expecting weekend guests.  The camp staff was very nice, said they understood that families often have plans that change in summer, and that if kids cannot attend, it's fine.

Dad (husband) says they have to keep going.
It's not far from home, but is out of the way. I work part time and have to go into my work site, but I have a very flexible schedule so it's really not any trouble to take them or pick them up - but - 

Why should they keep going? 

They are both smart and pretty cooperative at home. They are not learning much there. I think when you try an activity that turns out to be mediocre as an adult, you can decline to continue with it. 

So, parents, should they keep going? The main reason at this point is because ""Dad says we have to"". I feel OK with them quitting and do not expect either child to do triple the amount of housework if they quit, some extra chores, yes, OK, but nothing extreme.  I don't want this to turn into a power struggle between kids and Dad or my husband and I.  I just don't see the point in them going to a camp that is not teaching them much and that they are merely tolerating."
Parenting,school technology,k4r6cw,Distance Learning Struggles,"On the verge of tears while writing this. I just need to get this off my chest. Maybe some of you will have felt the same way or be going through similar circumstances. I’m not necessarily looking for any answers or suggestions, but if you have them go for it, it can’t hurt to try something new, or maybe someone else will be helped with them ideas too.

To start off I snapped today, and yelled at a family member who was trying to help with distance learning for my kid (6yo), and my kid heard all of it and started crying. I feel absolutely wrecked having upset him like that. I know it really bothered him and I consoled him after.

What brought this all about is my child has been struggling daily to complete his assignments, participate in meetings, and just do any school work in general. He has on Mon, Wed, Fri about 3 hours of synchronized learning on GoogleMeets with his entire class, and on Tue and Thur he has those meetings plus 2 small group meetings that are about 30 mins each (4 hrs total of meetings), plus everyday he has about 4 or 5 asynchronous assignments that should take about 15 mins each. He is supposed to do all of this learning in between 9:30am to 3:00pm and have time for a lunch and recess. We barely can fit this in this time frame, many days we are doing school work till 4 or 5 pm. 

Most of my day consists of encouraging him to start or get back to work on his assignments, and stepping him though any assignments with writing. He refuses to complete any written assignments on his own, and has me letter for letter step him through them, it takes us in between 1-2 hrs to do those types of assignments, when each assignment should on average be taking him about 10-15 mins total. He gets up and goofs off too during this time too, despite being constantly reprimanded with time outs and taking privileges away. When we do get him to sit down he constantly moves around, draws pictures, and continues to not focus. We also take 10-15 min breaks after each assignment is completed if we have time.

This is a struggle, because I am a single Mom, and was laid off due to covid, and I can’t continue to not work, but I feel as if he will fall further behind in school if I am not here to help him. So, for now I am choosing to not work, which isn’t a problem yet because I have some savings from unemployment and a small severance pay. I’ve been out of work since the beginning of July. I can technically afford to be out of work probably until next fall if I budget wisely, and unexpected expenses don’t happen, but I’d much rather get back to work, and be able to move into our own place. 

The family member I yelled at today is his grandmother, and she has repeatedly said she would help with his school work, but everyday she continues to do very little to help him, and has refused to learn anything about the apps and technology he has to use to do his assignments. I have solely been helping him almost 100% of the time. 
Today, I recognized I was struggling keeping a cool head, and I asked her to help because I had just had it trying to get him to do any work at all. 

She started with asking me questions about his assignments which she could have answered if she read the directions, kept asking where his work was in his back pack, which he knows how to find, and then when I found out he mixed up turning something in on the wrong assignment she wouldn’t let me explain how to fix it and then just said “fine you help him” and got mad at me for trying to explain. This is when I yelled at her “Stop! Just Stop!” because she wouldn’t let me explain and kept talking over me that she understood when she didn’t. My kid started crying, and she went on to explain how I was wrong, and she knew how to do it, even though she was the one who asked what was wrong about it, and then blamed me for getting heated when she had talked over me to the point I couldn’t explain anything to her. 

She has seen my son, and I struggle through the last 3 months of distance learning plus last spring March-June, and has continued to say she will help, but is absent when it really comes to help. 

What’s even more frustrating is she spends most of her day sleeping, and leaves the cleaning and chores around the house for me to get done on my own when I’m also trying to step my kid through his assignments. I pay rent to my parents, so it’s not like I’m doing chores as a way to make up for not having to pay rent. I do the chores because they need to get done and she will complain and complain but doesn’t lift a finger to help get the ones she complains about done. 

I’ve contacted my sons teacher about our struggles with his school work, and my concerns with his education, multiple times, and have followed all of her advice, but nothing seems to be working. I’m tired of asking her for help when I’ve tried all the things she has suggested. 

I’m frustrated and exhausted, and just mentally worn out. I’m worried about so much, and I just feel like I’m going to loose my shit almost daily. 

I know this might sound crazy, but I kind of wish that the public schools here had just decided to have kids out of school until they could be back in person. I know having a whole year or more off of school isn’t the best solution, but what would be so bad about these kids starting where they left off when they can go back in person. What is the hang up about kids having to complete school by a certain age? So what if they finish high school when they are 19 or 20 instead of the typical 18. I think the stress of distance learning on the kids and families is far worse for the child’s well being than being held back a year or two in school especially,  if being held back was normalized, and just what people did as a group decision. 

I’m at a total loss. I’m literally praying we make it through the rest of the school year, and I’m not a believer in prayer. I know I need support, but the support we have is not working. Just feeling super defeated."
Parenting,school technology,napql3,Teaching my 12yo some tech self control,"My 12yo son's school is currently closed (COVID) and he's on remote Zoom learning for \~4-5 hours a day.  He's a bright kid and doing well, however I keep finding him using tech inappropriately.  It started with him watching youtube videos *during* class.  When I caught him doing this, he lost his after school screen time privilege's for a week.

I've found him using the communal iPad for hours at night (2am to 6am) several times.  Further grounding, further loss of screen time.  Passwords changed.

Back and forth we go, him using tech inappropriately, we further grounding and trying to educate.

Today, I discovered he has been opening Youtube video's during Zoom classes and minimising them, and just listening to the audio while in class.

I've repeatedly sit down with him to explain why he needs to focus during school time and get his sleep, as well as follow the house rules around screen time etc, however I feel like he's at the point of paying lip service to my lectures and we're getting nowhere.

I feel like there are two problems here:

1. He has no fear of repercussions, or the repercussions are not severe enough for him to enact his own self control when the lure of distraction rears it's head.
2. I have not implemented the necessary tools to block behaviour at inappropriate times (eg: watching youtube video's in the middle of the night etc).  In other words, enforce our house tech rules.

I work in Tech. I know what options I have to arbitrarily start blocking apps/sites and restricting screen time.  I've always been more of the opinion that we as parents teach better when we are teaching skills like self control, time management etc, rather than reverting to draconian measures such as restricting access, limiting screen time and blocking sites, however I feel like I'm at an impasse with my son and I have no choice but to start severely blocking/restricting.

My son is technology inclined.  He's an avid programmer and loves to tinker with electronics (arduino's, raspberry pi's etc), so I want to encourage his exploration of tech and new ideas, but I also want him to learn that there's a time and place for doing that exploration, and it's not during English or Math zoom lessons!

 Do you agree? Any tips or ideas for me to work with my son on this?"
Parenting,school technology,fggbzm,Very serious disagreement on computer use in the house. How do we get through this?,"My son is 6 years old, and he wants his own computer. I am a very computer heavy user. My wife uses her laptop for work all the time. My son wants to play minecraft together and I couldn't be more excited about it. I think he is still a couple years away from really getting how that game works though, I was thinking around 8. But he knows I have an old computer just waiting for him, because I updated mine a couple years ago. (Kid can't remember what happened at school today, but still remembers me saying we had an old computer from 2 years ago.. little punk!) I have no problem with setting it up and letting him have at it with some kid software, and sitting next to me while I do my thing. So it will absolutely be supervised. Now meet my wife, she HATES tvs, computers, and screen time. Now, I don't disagree with her on screen time, and keeping it minimal. He does seem to have obsessions about gaming and tv time. But I also know there are very beneficial programs out there for him to use at his age that will give him a leg up on stuff later in life. She is very adamant about not letting him play on the computer and wants to decrease his screen time in general.

Now I believe screen time studies focus on tv, which is just staring at a screen and going ""brain dead"". So there is a stigma on ALL screen time. I don't see how being creative on Minecraft, or drawing apps, or learning to code is bad screen time. I am trying to see her point of view because she's very bookish and resistant to technology, and I am polar opposite.. I LOVE tech. And to see him getting interested in it, excites me.

Now the issue.. how are we suppose to work passed this? She talks about this situation like he won't have a computer until he's 12, minimum. I want him to have one around 8-10. I feel like this is a very sticky situation. I liken it to circumcision. I am sure throughout history is filled with one parent for circumcision and one against.. Very strong beliefs on both ends. How do THEY compromise in this situation? I am trying to be calm about this, but I also get frustrated with how stonewalled my points are being deflected. Because she has ""read case after case that says screen time is bad"" and she even threw ""if you aren't gonna read about this, I don't want to even have this conversation"" despite me saying I HAVE read them. As mentioned above, I have my doubts that creative and productive screen time is bad. 

So, this seems like maybe I should direct this at couples therapy type thing.. but I thought I would start here. This is a pretty big issue for both of us and I feel like both our points are valid."
Parenting,school technology,lxdesm,How did we do it way back then...,"I think I’m spoiled on modern technology and have lost the ability to cope with noise/distractions. 

I have to write a research paper for a continuing ed class I’m taking.  I am SO grateful to have a laptop I can work on in my bedroom, public library, or any room I can close a door to. 

Which makes me wonder...I was in high school/college in the late 90s/early 2000s. No laptop. Family computer was in a nook right off the kitchen and family/tv room. In college I had a clunky desktop computer in a loud dorm with a louder roommate. The computer labs weren’t very quiet either. Can anyone else relate to this? How and where did you write your papers before the luxury of portable devices (and wifi)! How did you cope with noise/distractions?"
Parenting,school technology,jnknxw,7y son in 1st grade struggling with reading,"Hello fellow parents! My son began homeschooling  the beginning of April. He was almost finished with kindergarten. During that stage, he was supposed to learn about the sounds of the remaining letters of the alphabet that they had left (I think it was s-z) & sight words. Once homeschooling began, there were a lot of issues. Its understandable given the fact that it was a huge transition from being taught all day in class with the teacher available at any given minute to having to figure out the technology, layouts of the web pages, roadblocks, etc. I was a little nervous about him starting 1st grade because I felt that he was slightly delayed due to the transition. 

At the beginning of this school year (August), I spoke with his teacher and she reassured me that the class would be going over some of the stuff taught at the end of kindergarten to ensure the students have learned those assignments thoroughly. Its November now and my son is still struggling with reading. We have tried reading workbooks purchased online, YouTube videos, practiced reading and writing. He can't seem to grasp the long and short sounding vowels. Also, silent letters throw him for a loop. I mentioned this to the teacher in our last parent-teacher conference & she told me not to worry, hes actually one of the advanced learners in her class. 

When I sit with him and read, I can see how much he is struggling. He gets frustrated and upset when he can't figure it out and I can see his self esteem drop. 

Are there any tips, recommendations of learning apps or programs that'll help him with his reading? I really appreciate any advice, tips and tricks. My son is a very  bright boy and it really hurts me to see him feel like he isn't smart enough or that he can't do it. I really want to get him up to speed so he can be just as confident as he is with Math and the other subjects he excels at. 

I really appreciate it!(:"
Parenting,school technology,evszhq,What to do when your preteen hits teachers,"I have no idea what to do anymore. Neither does my stepsons father or his biomom. We don't allow technology in the home, we found it made him violent and so tv is not a thing except for family movie nights, and video games are allowed on long car rides or as a reward. We've given clear reasonable communication of expectations and consequences. We've begged and pleaded. We've threatened punishment and we've promised rewards. And it feels like he keeps escalating. 

It started with screaming at the teachers, then escalated to slamming the door in their faces, then he kicked his personal care assistant at school, and then he rammed a teacher with his desk in her stomach. He got suspended for those last two. 

He knows it's unacceptable. He knows what to do when he's upset instead of hitting. At home he demonstrates it all the time, I'm mad I'm gonna go for a walk, I feel like I need to scream I'm gonna go scream into my pillow, my fists feel angry I'm gonna play with my stressball. He does all of that at home without prompting. 

At home however he doesn't listen the first or second time we have to growl at him or yell him or physically guide him into listening. Hell decide he doesn't want to talk about what were talking about and will interrupt the adults and start making loud noises to distract us, and no matter how politely or firmly we tell him to stop or there will be consequences, he doesn't until we guide him to a corner and growl at him that he's being rude. 

At school he decides he doesn't want to do his work, and won't do it and it escalates until hes in trouble. It's not like the teachers are too nice or too mean, it's like they say do this, he does what he wants and gets caught, they take away the distraction and tell him to do his work again, he says no and gets rude, they tell him it's not optional he has to do his work, and he goes off because he doesn't want to do his work. But at home he has no problem doing his homework. 

I just don't know what to do anymore. Neither do his bioparents. We've been trying to get in touch with behavior programs but they won't call us back or email us back. We're all but ready to send him to military school."
Parenting,school technology,invuo1,Technology meltdowns,"Well here I (35 f) am again. (TL:DR at the end) The last time I posted here it was during lockdown and I had had a major conflict with my eldest son (now 14) over a curfew on technology. I let the curfew slide over the summer as we were out of all routines and there were lots of sleepovers and meet ups with friends.

School is now back in full swing in our country so I had warned my son that we will be back to curfews on technology. He instantly went into a full blown meltdown. He spent an hour screaming and crying. He threw chairs around the kitchen and slammed doors. He called me a bitch and a cunt. My son is 5'11"" and athletic so this was an extremely volatile situation. 

What concerned me the most was that throughout the whole episode he kept saying how this will ruin his life and his whole year. That I didn't understand that he was involved in something deep. He said it isn't bad but he still can't tell me about it. I asked if we could talk about it with out naming anybody and find a way to work around whatever this important issue was while still adhering to the curfew. But all I got was that I was stupid and don't understand.

He has lost the privilege of using his phone for the next few days and I gave him 5 minutes to let whoever's is involved in the ""something deep"" that he won't be online for a few days. He chose to carry on the screaming and crying for those 5 minutes. I don't want to invade his privacy but I am worried that he has become too emotionally attached and dependent on his phone. I don't want to cut him off from his friends but I also know that he lacks the maturity to make good choices and regulate himself.

Any insights would be most welcome. I feel completely overwhelmed by my teenagers.

TL:DR  Son had a major meltdown when technology curfews were reinstated. Says he is involved in something deep on his phone but won't share any details. I am worried he is too emotionally attached to his phone and social media."
Parenting,school technology,f98l9y,"Kids feeling sad, not sure what's best to do.","Yesterday when I got home, my wife said that our Son (10) had come down from bed saying he felt sad.  He wouldn't say why, but he started crying.  I went up to speak to him but he was asleep (pretending) by this point.  

Just a but of background information on my Son, he's just turned 10 years old, he's a very bright and intelligent boy, but he's not the most emotional kid, or at least he doesn't show it.  He often has a different way of thinking to me, such as as we left the theater after watching Star Wars, in my head I'm thinking I'm the Jedi saving the day, and I ask him what he's thinking, and he replies, 'where do they get the technology from to build the spaceship?'

This morning he came in for a cuddle and we could tell he was still feeling sad.  He wouldn't talk about it though, but he was refusing to get ready for school.  Our two younger kids were ready, and I needed to go to work, so it was a bit awkward.  My wife took the younger kids to school, and I stayed with our Son to find out why he was sad.  

Obviously worried about bullying or something inappropriate etc. all things going through my head.  He said he was sad about my Mum and Dad dying.  My Dad died 4 years ago after a long illness, and my mum died of cancer 10 months ago, after spending 4 months in a hospice.  My Son was always very close to my Mum and Dad because he was our first Grandchild and they used to take him out a lot and he had sleepover etc.  They idolised him as he was such a lovely child.  He used to be a champion gymnast but after my Dad died he refused to go to gymnastics anymore, we didn't understand at the time as Dad was never involved in his gymnastics anyway, so we 'forced' him to continue until it was obvious he wasn't interested.  

When my Mum died last year, she had been in the Hospice for 4 months and it was not a nice way to go for any of us.  The week before she died my Wife was rushed to hospital and spent a week there.  Then she had a serious/life saving operation later last year, so it was a difficult time for us all really, but the kids seemed to cope well, as I tried to keep routines, and make things fun for them while my wife was in hospital for 8 weeks.  

This morning I eventually got him ready, I talked about nice memories of my Mum and Dad and how they used to talk about my Son etc. and all the things they did together, we had breakfast and then I took him to school.  He still insisted he didn't want to go and you could tell by looking at him he was still upset, but he went in all the same, albeit about an hour late.  

I'm now sitting in work wondering if we've done the right thing? Should I have kept him off and away from normal routine? I'm really not sure how to handle this going forward.  We've recently been discussing going on vacation in the Summer to a place where my Parents always took me when I was a kid, perhaps that could be the trigger.."
Parenting,school technology,cpkf66,Back-to-school is going to break me.,"Oldest kiddo is going into 3rd grade this year - we just received our school supply list from the district. Majority of it is the normal stuff - composition notebooks, number 2 pencils, headphones, etc. 

But this school year, students 3rd grade & up are required to have an iPad to do school assignments and homework on. Not a problem, I get it. Technology is the way of the future.

But why, oh WHY do the parents have to pay $150 for the ""insurance"" of the device? We also have to buy a ""school approved"" case for the device and the options listed are $30 or more. This is something I just cannot afford as single parent. I emailed the principal of her school to see if there are any ways I can do a payment plan throughout the school year and the principal's response was the standard ""If they don't have it, they will fail."" yadda yadda. I know I can't be the only parent who will be having trouble finding the funds for this. 

Open house at her school is on the 22nd and I plan on speaking to her teacher this year about this issue. I still have to buy back to school clothes and special sneakers for gym class because apparently Walmart shoes just don't cut it anymore (also she has to have a gym uniform and it has to be from the school store this year too! Another fifty ish dollars down the drain, sweet)

I don't understand how other parents do it. This is the first school year where I'm really gonna struggle and well, it stinks."
Parenting,school technology,8wl436,"New parents born in the late 80s-early 90s, I have a question","How do you plan to raise your children in terms of electronic exposure?

I was born in 1988.

I remember being a young child and playing outside until the street lights came on. Taking bike rides with neighborhood kids while trying to find something to do. Impromptu games of kickball, manhunt, and random games we'd come up with. I remember just wandering

I also remember being in high school and having broadband internet at home and being able to surf and chat til the wee hours of the morning. Having the latest cellphone that I would use to text constantly (on that God-awful T9 keyboard) or surf the shitty internet browser. Writing about my entire life online in AIM profile or Myspace page.

Sometime in middle school is where I remember the line being crossed from the old days to the new (and current) days. I'm not denying the great things that technology does for us and our children, but I fear my child growing up addicted to and consumed by it. I see so many children nowadays glued to their cell phone or tablet, some being as young as 2 years old. A lot of them don't seem to get the same joy out of outdoor or social activities as children who are not obsessed by technology. This behavior just seems to carry on through the years. The last family function I went to, literally all the children were either glued to a cell phone or TV with game console the entire time.

I don't want that for my child. I want her to know the same joys I did as a young child; playing outside and exploring my little world. But I also want her to be a capable player in today's technology-driven world. She's only 5 months old, but I'm sure by kindergarten, her peers will all be well-versed in electronics and I want her to have the same knowledge without being addicted to it.

How do you handle the use of electronics for your children? (I directed this at parents from my generation, because we got to taste both worlds and can speak to the pros/cons of both.)

*Edit: Thank you for all the responses! The main themes that kept coming up seemed to be that children will do as you do, moderation is key, and to avoid putting electronics on a pedestal. All the comments were helpful and it was great insight to hear how other parents in my age range have managed this issue.* "
Parenting,school technology,iteq65,Virtual school( my kid won't sit),"My kid just turned six and started kindergarten. In the area where I live all school is virtual. She is working off of a very nice Chromebook and the teachers in my opinion are doing an amazing job of being engaging and teaching the children technology.

My daughter won't sit in front of her computer and it's a constant fight to get her to sit during class. If she's one-on-one with her teacher she does great but I also understand the teacher cannot be one-on-one with her because she has a class to teach. 
My daughter says she's scared and doesn't want everybody to see her but no solution we provide works.
Any suggestions?"
Parenting,school technology,8agrtq,Daughter (7) admits she doesn't have many people to play with at school. What can I do help?,"My daughter has always been very shy, top of the class and, I assumed, plenty of social interaction with friends. Over the past year or so she speaks less of her friends she met in nursery and more of a few others but last week she said she didn't have anyone to play with. We do have kids on our street and young family members she happily plays with. 

I know she struggles with new people or just playing with anyone like other kids would but didn't know she felt like this. We moved house not long ago and she begged us not to swap her school but now she said she wouldn't mind it...which seems unlike her.

Few things I have considered, but wanted other people opinion on:

Talking to the teacher, see what she thinks.

Too much technology? We have an iPad and Nintendo, PC the works. While we're usually pretty cautious about her playing games she will always prefer go out. I work in the video game industry so it's hard to avoid but would reducing time sat behind a screen help her socially? 

Letting her play out on her own? We don't let her play out often, when she does she doesn't go out of sight. She still seems young to me but I was out at a younger age when I was a kid.

As I said she is a clever kid more into books and crafts sort of thing than imaginary play or sports. I think this might have something to do with it as her hobbies aren't what the stereotypical kids are. I also feel like a lot of the other kids are quite old for their age.

Thanks"
Parenting,school technology,ap5qau,Do you do consequences in addition to the school ones?,"My 9 year old got in trouble at school. He and four other boys started kicking pinecones at each other during recess which escalated to throwing them, hard,  at each other's heads. Principal assigned them to spend their next few recesses picking up trash on campus,  which is a logical response. Now I've made it clear we fully support the school on this and told my son he's on thin ice   at home. We gave a technology time out this weekend (which happened to fall on a weekend he had lots of other things to distract him) and an early bedtime all next week. Is that enough? I feel like we're aren't doing enough but the school consequence is perfect. Do I just trust the principal is handling it? I also teach at this school which makes me inclined to be extra harsh, because I'm embarrassed in front of my boss. "
Parenting,school technology,hb4xpk,Is this a fitting punishment.,"Okay I typically only browse reddit but today I dedicated ided to make an account and post for a change because I'm stuck. Last year on March 3 2019 (I know the specifics because this took place after my nephews b day party) I went through my son's phone ( who was 14 at the time) and found that he had a snapchat, Instagram and Twitter when he knew he wasn't allowed to have any of them. I also found some disturbing ""memes"" like some of nazis and some suicide jokes that he claimed he made before the kid at his school hung himself but I don't believe him. Obviously upset I took his phone and haven't gave it back to him. Since then I have caught him multiple more times sneaking on technology and making social media accounts to talk to his friends. He came up to me yesterday and begged to have his phone back. He said he should have it back seeing as he turns 16 in December and hasn't been able to talk to his friends from his old school in over a year since we enrolled him in online school this past year. Should I give him it back? Should I do weekly searches like I used to? What do you guys do?

Edit:Another on of his reasons was that he rarely gets to see/talk to kids his own age seeing as the only kid he hangs out with is only able to see him once every two sometimes once a week for a few hours and he gets bored sitting in his room all day (I also took away his games) but I told him that those are the consequences of lying and disrespecting me."
Parenting,school technology,8xezor,Video games -- this is new territory for me. How much is too much? How do I know if it's appropriate for a 10 year old?,"My daughter has never been interested in video games.  She does not have a cell phone, although she plays on mine occasionally to message her older (grown and gone) sisters.  She doesn't have any type of social media accounts (I'm not sure if 10 year olds do or not, but she doesn't).

So this summer she asked if she could download Roblox on her Kindle.  I had no idea what it was, but it was the first time she ever asked for any kind of game/app (other than like Barbie coloring pages and stuff like that), so I said sure.  

Now it consumes her.  She plays on it every day and watches YouTube videos from someone called InquistorMaster.  I've watched the videos, too, and they seem pretty harmless.

I guess she's playing with other people online because she talks about ""friends"" in the game like they're real people.  She's talked about some dramas, and I've talked to her about not getting involved in online drama (fighting, bickering, etc.).  

She goes to a rather small private school, so her real-life friend base is pretty small.  I have some pretty severe social anxiety issues, so that kind of limits her, too.  Kind of hard to make friends when your mom never leaves the house.  So I'm not averse to her having online friends.  I just want to know if Roblox is okay for kids.

She's pretty much always playing or drawing while she watches the Roblox videos, and she only plays the game for a bit in the morning and in the evening.  She does other kid stuff like play outside and go swimming.  I'm not too concerned about the amount she plays (when I say consumes her, I mean everything she draws or plays now has something to do with Roblox).  I'm just concerned about a 10 year old interacting with others online.  I assume these are other kids, but it's online, so who knows?

Anybody have any experience with games like Roblox?  Is there something I should look out for?  I know my kid is probably behind the times technology-wise, but I'm just not a person who cares or knows much about technology, so it hasn't become a big part of our family life."
Parenting,school technology,f01yk9,Daughter impersonated a friend so she could fake her own death on social media,"UPDATE : my daughter spoke to me after school today and told me exactly what happened. Her friend was allegedly in on the whole thing, and it was a prank they pulled on an old bully of hers. 

For everyone thinking I wasn't taking the situation seriously, get off your high horse. To everyone else, thank you for taking tje time to comment. 

Overreacting without talking to my daughter first would 100% have been the wrong thing to do. Obviously the prank wasn't funny, but that is a complete different issue. 



ORIGINAL POST:
I feel ridiculous even typing this out. Today my teenager asked me to disable her Instagram account. Last night she casually mentioned she'd told someone from her primary school that she was dead. I thought it was weird but didn't pry. 

Today after she asked me disable her insta account , I decided to have a look at her messages, which I never do, though I always have access to her account. Under normal circumstances I wouldn't look and just respect her privacy.

Telling people she's dead isn't something I take lightly, worse know that I know that she impersonated her best friend to do so. 

From the brief look that I read, she was telling this other person that she(daughter) was dead and that she (impersonated friend) wasn't sad because daughter was a bitch. She was also messaging the person that she (impersonated friend) was high and a crack head, which in reality she's not. 

My dilemma is I don't know how to bring this incident up with my daughter, though I know I will have to. 

Confiscating her technology or grounding her won't work. (She isn't currently living with me). 

How can I talk to her about what's going on without having her shut down on me? We have a pretty open and honest relationship, but this behaviour is obviously very concerning, and I understand why she wouldn't want me to know these things."

She never gets in trouble in school. My mom never sees the anger. With me if I don't know what she's talking about she yells at me. I tell her yelling is unacceptable. She says ""i don't care"" when I try to explain anything to her. She also says that to her little sister on a regular basis. If I make her take a shower when she doesnt want to she gets more and more worked up about it and will eventually start screaming. She says i dont want to take a shower over and over and over. I have consequences but they seem to do nothing. I take away technology or the fun things we have planned. She tells me she'll stop screaming if i let her do the thing i took away. I tell her that's not how it works. To me, she seems like an angry teenager. I'm totally lost and I want to fix this before she does become a teenager. I'm at my wits end!"
Parenting,school technology,3vgw5y,I need advice from parents that let their teen's play games.,"Hello! I'm a 43 year old mother and I have a son, age 14 that I bought an Xbox one for him 3 months ago. It has been an honest nightmare for me and my husband since we bought him the system.

My son has about 3 games for the Xbox that we bought the same day we got him the system. Grand theft Auto, Battle Field, Call of duty. My husband hooked the thing up to his TV in his room. 

And two days later that's when it started. He swears constantly 24/7, he hasn't been outside the past 3 months. He's always in his room. He also LOCKS his door so me and my husband can't get in. He hits my husband and I when we go in to his room when he forgets to keep it locked. He used to be an active kid, now the doctors said he's borderline overweight.

We get calls from the school saying he's not social anymore, he eats by him self or with 1-2 of his friends. We've got behavior reports from school saying he has an attitude towards his fellow classmates & disrespects teachers.

I don't know what to do anymore, Should I throw away the xbox? Is this a phase? And he has had no incident like this in the past. Me and my husband can't sleep at night due to the swearing and loud talking.

I apologize if this is not the right place to post this.




As a response to everybody that replied and I have read all of your wonderful advice. My husband and I decided together that we're going to take the Xbox away until he's mature enough to respect us and others. I don't know much of technology but I feel that it is a need to take it away because of his anger, cursing and school. We have also decided to take off the lock to his room, my husband called his brother and he's going to take it out tomorrow. And we have arranged a meeting for tomorrow morning to tell my son everything. 

I appreciate you all. Thank you!

Parenting,school technology,5hu6gb,A classmate (7) just passed away. Do I tell son tonight or let him find out at school?,"My son (7) has a classmate who has been battling cancer for about 6 months. As parents, we were aware of it at the end of 1st grade, and he was placed in the same class as DS for 2nd.  A special nurse came to school, explained his situation, and gave some advice as to how to be a good classmate/friend.  

I found out this evening that the sweet boy passed away early Saturday morning.  His mother shared the funeral information via facebook, and I haven't stopped crying since.  


Some background info that I think is pretty important.  My dad passed away 6 months ago on my son's 7th birthday.  DS was extremely effected by this, and I felt so helpless with this depression.  I've had him in counseling for the semester, but it's through a University program, so our last session for the semester was last week.  He has seen his school counselor as well, as she had concerns over his grief.  

Now that our classmate has passed away, I don't know what to do.  Do I tell him before he goes to school tomorrow, or have the counselors tell him? I can't keep him home, I have to go to work.  It kills me to think about him having more grief in his life, when he is still pretty effected by the loss of his grandpa.  And the funeral?  Can he handle that?  I am so torn and heartbroken and helpless for his innocent feelings.  

EDIT: thanks everyone. It was getting late and i already sent him to bed, but I knew he wasn't asleep yet. He came to me for another reason and saw the page up. I made the decision to tell him tonight. We cried and hugged and cried and hugged. My heart broke over and over again. Weird- as soon as I told him, I stopped my sobbing and went more into a protective/comforting mode for him. 

I told him that he can talk to his counselor tomorrow if he needs to. I also told him that his classmates might not know yet, so we needed to let the adults at school tell them. Honestly not sure if he's going to be able to hold that in, so I emailed his teacher telling her that he knows (technology!).  Finally, I advised him against wearing his shirt in support of the boy (that we just bought on Friday) because people may walk up and talk to him about even more, and he might not want that right away. 

Thank you all again. It was never going to be a winning situation, but I felt so helpless and needed someone! Thank you guys for being that community"
Parenting,school technology,c0jldi,Children and Video Games,"My wife and I have two awesome kids - 8 and 10, boys.  Generally well behaved, smart, and inquisitive. Great kids. 

The oldest one is wildly fascinated by electronics and has shown aptitude for programming and computer science.  I bring him home old computers from work (that would be tossed, no theft) and he cobbles them together (with some help) to try and get them running.  He spends hours on his computer tinkering with MIT's [scratch.mit.edu](https://scratch.mit.edu) website, building games and other apps.  He loves getting robotics kits and trying to make them work, and has tinkered with a Raspberry Pi.  Most of what he wants to do is advanced for any kid his age, and probably beyond most teenagers.  He was accepted into the gifted programs at his school for technology and science.

The youngest one has an amazing imagination and artistic flair.  He uses paper, tape, glue, and staples to craft his monsters and landscapes that he sees in his head.  He writes detailed, wild stories in his journals and draws out the characters and themes he describes - often in detail exceeding his peers.  He's obsessed with monsters, in particular anything that eats people.  Last Christmas I made him a 24"" paper mache Audrey II from the *Little Shop of Horrors*, complete with teeth, tongue, and leaves.  It sleeps next to his bed. He's recently been accepted into the gifted program at school for writing and art.

The parenting advice needed comes in from an event this morning with my wife.  The kids have recently discovered multiplayer Minecraft.  They're obsessed with it and want to play **all the time**.  Today they actually woke up and hour earlier than usual, without alarms or prompting, in hopes of getting more time on their computers to play together.  My wife lost her cool and shut it all down.  Since discovering gaming, our youngest hasn't shown any desire for creativity, imagination, writing, or building.

We're both worried that his imagination will be stifled if he spends too much time gaming, but are disagreeing on how to manage it.  I want to set up a system of rewards where PC gaming time is earned by both kids for doing other activities that are unrelated to games.  She wants to strictly limit them to one day a week where they can play and force them to do other things the other 6 days.  We're at odds on this and can't decide.

I was curious how the parents of Reddit would look at this and solve it."

However it's gone beyond just that sort of thing lately, he's become quite adamantly anti-technology/modern things, won't use a computer or a phone or watch any of the television programmes or movies that he used to love, he calls all sorts of modern culture from music to the styles that people dress in ""disgusting rubbish"", he's falling behind in school because he won't do a lot of the work that requires he use the computer, and he got in big trouble when his teacher told him that his writing has to be submitted electronically so that it can be put through a programme to check for plagiarism and he called her ""a lazy, useless bitch who has a machine do her job for her."" 

He used to want to be a lawyer, now when he grows up he tells me that he wants to live off the lands. I don't really talk to his mates' parents but I think that this is something that they're going through together, because they like to do survivalist type things like go into the woods and make fires with sticks and whatnot. I don't even know if this is something that I should be concerned about, aside from the rudeness to his teacher, as so many parents would love for their teenagers to be less into technology, but to me it's just bizarre how he and his mates are basically rejecting the whole world and wanting to live in the woods. Is this a trend or something?"
Parenting,school technology,gxkoud,10yo New Room,"Hey everyone (sorry in advance for bad grammar, I'm currently on my phone), my wife and I are nearly at our wits end, my wife more so.

Last year in April we welcomed our first child together (10 year old is my step son), 11 months later we had our second.

Our current house has three bedrooms upstairs and one massive bedroom downstairs that used to be a ""game room"". With the first born getting ready to transition to a bed, and the new born getting ready to transfer to the crib, we made a weekend out of moving our sons bedroom downstairs.

I'm just going to say now that this wasn't dropped on him, it had been discussed openly with him through the pregnancy of the new born.

He seemed to really enjoy helping take all the consoles and games down, and then take all his stuffies, nerf guns, toys, etc down into his new room. He set it all up that night, we gave him a TV and an Xbox one for his room (we had it collecting dust), he genuinely seemed excited, and this put the wife and my fears at ease.

He stays with his biological father every other week, he doesn't really have any kind of structure there, without going into great detail, he is allowed to stay up quite a bit later and they often don't do much outside of hanging out with his sisters and playing games. He has no problem at night there.

With the covid pandemic and the schools shut down we are doing everything in our powers to ensure he gets enough exercise through out the day, eats healthy and is off all technology one hour before bed.

All was great for the first week, but when he came back it was like he flipped a switch. He is absolutely terrified of the basement, so much so that it brings him to tears (the basement is finished).

He said the noises were keeping him up, so we opted to let him listen to audio books while he fell asleep, that worked for one night.

He is up until 2 am or 3 am, completely unable to sleep, then he is up at 8 am or 9 am. I know this isn't at all good for anyone let alone a child. But even through several attempts at quell his fears, without mocking or force we are at our wits end.

We give him equal time alone and together with all the kids, none of that has changed, his days keep him busy with school work, video games, bike rides, chores, etc.

My wife feels like a failing mother despite all my reassuring, id just like for us to find something so he can feel at peace and my wife won't feel down in the dumps.

I'm sorry if this doesn't follow guide lines, but I am very thankful for any and all advice anyone has to offer.

Thanks."
Parenting,school technology,eywhqt,"Having a hard time with my 9yo’s behavior, mostly at school, but also at home.","So, more recently my 9yo has been getting in trouble at school for being disruptive and not listening. She has been in trouble for this before, and has been grounded for it(loss technology/tablet). She was good for a few days, but nothing sticks. She has been separated from other students to help eliminate her talking, but yesterday she forged my wife’s signature on a sheet that had to come home. Obviously she failed, she’s 9, but why would she even try?
She’s the oldest of 4(9/6/4 yo twins), so is this an attention grab? And how do you deal with it? I’m 45, we got our asses beat as kids, and we learned respect from it, but in today’s world there’s no way this is an option. The other kids aren’t like this(yet...?). 
I’m hoping I don’t have to send her to boot camp..."
Parenting,school technology,ib5tsx,Is my kid addicted to technology?,"I’m wondering if my kid could be addicted to technology. She’s 4 years old and I feel awful for saying this because of course it’s partially my fault. But lately we’ve been more lax with tv and devices, more so with devices and also audio books. My main worry is actually audiobooks. She asks to listen to one of her audiobooks to wake up in the morning, fall asleep, while she eats meals and snacks, and any other time of the day she isn’t devoting 100% attention to something else. She cannot fall asleep without listening to an audiobook or something like Moshi, and is grumpy in the morning until she gets to listen to her books (she wakes up early and it’s easy to give in when we want to sleep until 6:30 or 7) Tonight Putting her to bed I just wanted to talk about her day and we started talking for a minute or two and then she said she was getting bored and wanted to listen to her cd book. I remember listening to books to fall asleep but not every day and definitely not at every meal and to help me wake up in the morning and multiple other times during the day. It’s a bad habit that I and especially my husband use and give into often. 

We limit movies to one a day or a few shows and sometimes nothing if we’re busy. My husband usually gives her his phone or the iPad a few times a day while he’s working and I’m nursing our baby. I worry that when she’s old enough to go to school she’ll have no attention to listen to a teacher. She was in preschool for only a few months before COVID started. 

We started audiobooks when she was between 18 months to 2 years and sleeping in a toddler bed to help her fall asleep in her room on her own and it worked so we kept doing it. 

I’d love either some reassurance that this won’t last forever but I’m pretty sure it will only get worse, since it’s only been getting worse the past few months. So also advice on how to curb this would be really appreciated. Any advice is welcome!"
Parenting,school technology,iksjox,Need advice for single mom (35f) who is at the end of her rope with 4 kids,"TLDR 4 kids, each in their own stage of development and learning and can’t find a method that works for any of them. Dad and I can’t get on the same page for discipline.

Each kid has their own set of challenges. Sorry for the long post. Their dad’s way of disciplining them is to stick them in their bed and not let them out for anything but meals and bathrooms, they are not allowed toys or books at all during punishments and they can last for 1 day-1 month. I have primary placement, and that doesn’t work. The kids don’t listen or stay in their beds and now cry and hate going by their dad.

Kid 1, 12F. She has had some issues with being bullied in the past and is the one who remembers the best when her Dad and I were still married. She has some bitterness and anger towards us. Most of her behavior issues revolve around technology. She breaks the rules with her phone or tv or computer for school. I take away technology and double up on chores and ground her from going outside until I feel like she has learned her lesson. As soon as she gets it back she does it again, or she continues to sneak behind my back and watch tv, etc. Some of the behaviors have been borderline dangerous, giving a stranger online her phone number, etc. She refuses to do her homework and lies about having it, says she’s doing her virtual learning but sits on YouTube all day, doesn’t turn stuff in even if it does get complete.. but she’s insanely intelligent so I know she can do it. It’s not a matter of it being too hard. And she ignores her teachers at times and just reads when she should be doing classwork . To a point where we had to stop allowing her to take personal books from school, but then she would go to the library and get them and hide them in her locker.

Kid 2, 6M (twin A), with ADHD and Autism (high functioning). Does not listen, does not care what punishments he gets. You can tell, spank, time our, wall sits/push ups, talk with him, social stories, make him clean (he won’t), ignore behavior, tons of different ways of positive reinforcement... But he won’t clean up after himself, has accidents still at night, he’s aggressive with his siblings, steals food in between meals even when given snacks or told no, takes things that doesn’t belong to him, lies....  I’m at a loss. I don’t know what to do anymore with him. He is the sweetest, most loving little boy, but my most difficult child. I’ve tried everything I can think of. He doesn’t respond to any of it.

Kid 3, 6M (twin B), also with ADHD and Autism (high functioning) and a LIST of physical health problems. He is my ex husband’s “favorite” and can do no wrong over there.. mostly because he’s just the sneakiest and rarely gets caught. He and the other 2 (his twin and the youngest) will join in together and do something they aren’t supposed to. Then he will come tattle, just leaving out that he was part of it too. He lies at times, but out of the 3 littles he is the best behaved. However, he refuses to clean up, ever. He will walk in circles with 1 toy and pretend to clean or just downright ignore me. I’ve tried all the same ways of discipline for him as well as the other twin, nothing seems effective.

Kid 4, 4F. Lies, constantly in stuff that isn’t hers, steals food too, (and trust me, my kids are all well fed). Is super sneaky, very aggressive and downright defiant when told to do something. Her and twin A cannot be in a room without them fighting and hurting one another. Same thing with disciplines. I can’t find one that she actually responds to.

So what would you do? I’m willing to do different things with each kid. Just need some new ideas. And i try each different technique for a minimum of 3weeks to be consistent and not keep switching stuff around. Help! I’m desperate. Where is super nanny when I need her?"
Parenting,school technology,d3ppuo,"Well, the time has come to give our oldest her own phone. Give me ALL the parenting oversight tips about this.","We already know ""physically examine text messages and social media"" so maybe we don't need that one. What we're really after is a suite of apps or one single great one that would possibly allow us to keep an eye on her a little more surreptitiously. She's just started Junior High but she's a year younger than her contemporaries. I have an older Samsung S7 that we're going to give her.

EDIT: She is a very high achiever at school and sensible and responsible beyond her years...... mostly. We don't believe that NOT using a smartphone is necessarily in her best interest as we want to keep her involved in the development of technology for her own future. We already DO limit time on her tablet and stuff and intend to do the same here."
Parenting,school technology,dgfvb3,"Hey new here, question about a teenager."," So I'm in a weird spot that I'm really not sure what to do. My son just turned 17 and is a junior in high school. He's going through a lot of that I think I'm adult but don't want responsibility thing that teens go through. As a freshman he wanted to go to Notre Dame, a real elite school. I think he quickly realized that probably wasn't gonna happen but he still wanted to go to college....then this year started. He signed up for CTC which is career technology center, it's basically a work training program for the morning at school. He had always told us he wanted to be a mechanical engineer....but he doesn't sign up for that program, he signs up for the auto mechanic program. He likes doing stuff with cars and all that so ok...  


6 weeks later after being an overachiever at school, he is failing classes, but not just failing, dramatically failing like a 17% in a class failing. He's in advanced prep for college classes and is not even trying, last night he told us he doesn't care about his grades and we shouldn't either because he's not going to college. This came about because we got an email he needed to sign up for a test to get college credit to which he said he didn't need that.  


Nothing against auto mechanics but it's super frustrating to watch him flush every goal to the point of not even caring about passing classes anymore because of 6 weeks of a auto tech class. I just don't really know what to do here, if he wants to be a mechanic I don't want to crap on him but I also feel like what he's doing is really not acceptable either. 

We've had some issues with him over the years where he is manipulative, thinks he's the smartest guy in the room. In short he is a very poor decision maker, if anyone has any questions to help them understand anything I posted I'm more than happy to answer because I can use any advice I can get at this point."
Parenting,school technology,9n5n40,Please watch out if your child has the app Lipsil!,"I wanted to post this for other parents out there with Teens or even preteens. 

My child had an app called Lipsil on her phone, it is an anonymous messaging app that lets you connect with local people. After going through the messages I was disgusted, shocked and devasted to see that people were messaging her the most vile disgusting things I've ever read. Asking her if she gives good head, that she has a fat ass and more vile things talking about hairless parts of the body. I know some of these people are other teens in her school, but some were probably not. I was physically I'll reading some of these posts. I had a very long talk with my daughter and deleted the app and will be keeping a very close eye on her. 

I know this is not the only one out there that does this. Just please keep a close eye on you kids when it comes to technology. 

Sorry if this is a rant but I do not wish this on anyone else's kid. "
Parenting,school technology,c3olo5,15 year old won’t do anything. How do I help him gain a desire to learn to do something?,"He loves to watch anime and play flash games. I have no problem with these in moderation, but he plays them to such a degree that he won’t do his homework unless I sit beside him, eyes glued to his screen. If I so much as read a book while sitting next to him, he’ll start playing again. It costs me so much time and I struggle to finish my own work because of it (I’m a primary teacher, I have markig every night. I can’t even do it while he’s working because I can’t take my eyes off him).

He’s failed almost all his classes this semester because he just won’t do the work. He was given a chance to repeat an assignment to pass, but he played games instead and turned in another incomplete assignment. 

He was sent off to stay with extended family for work experience this last week without access to technology, and the only feedback that we got was that he is lazy, unmotivated, and only does the bare minimum. This is coming from family. I’m so worried that he won’t be able to get it hold down a job at all. 

I started taking away his electronics, but he stole them back. I ended up buying a lockable toolbox to keep them in. I tried taking away his school computer at night, but he told his teachers that we weren’t letting him work on his homework and the school called me to make sure I gave it to him. He plays until 3 or 4 in the morning on his school computer, then gets the school to make me let him go home because he’s too tired to work. I’ve been made to meet with his teachers because of it and I’m worried they might think I’m just a shitty parent. 

He says he isn’t depressed. I thought it might be an ADHD issue or something related, but the doctor says he’s fine. I’ve even tried naturopaths and all the vitamins they’ve recommended, but nothing has changed. 

I’m so worried about him. What if he can’t graduate? How will he get a job? I love him, but what if something happens to me and I can’t take care of him? He won’t even learn to cook anything except for chicken nuggets in a sandwich press. What can I do to help inspire him? Am I the one to blame here? Does anyone have similar experiences? I’m so lost, please help."
Parenting,school technology,7vlaki,Daughter(11) being retaliated against and need advice.,"My daughter(11) had a a couple students in her class log into other people profiles and send message, change setting and just create havoc. Due to this the system was compromised and multiple classes lost their chrome book access. The principle mandated that every student must write a small essay(3-4) sentences on the rules of using this technology. My daughters home teacher decided that it needed to be a full page apology for every student in the class to regain the use of the technology. Even if they were involved in the situation or not the entire class needed to write apology letters. This happened during the school day and we didn't find out about it until just before school the next day. My daughter told my wife that they could have a chance to regain their privileges by doing this and my wife was livid. She called the principle and had a discussion on the fact that my daughter was basically being punished for something someone else had done. After she talked to the principle, they had professed complete objection to to the apology letter and had said that they would get it corrected. 
Today my crying daughter tells us that her apology letter had been rejected(The only rejection in the class) and she does not think her computer privilegese would be reinstated even though she did nothing wrong. I'm ready to go to war for my daughter. Both me and my wife are on the same page on this. My daughter is being punished for something she had nothing to do with is being further retaliated against because we raised opposition to unjust punishment. If there is anything I that can help me or bring things to light I would appreciate it. We are going to the principle in the morning to discuss everything.

On a side note my daughter has been honor roll and principles list every year since she started. She's a good kid and I don't want to see her tarnished by this. Part of my hopes she already hasn't."
Parenting,school technology,40dfs5,Internet Etiquette for my 10 year old,"I have a 10 year old son whose interest in technology and the internet is booming.  As a parent who grew up before the internet existed, I'm trying to figure out as best I can how to help him navigate the wonders (and pitfalls) he has access to.  

I did some research and created an internet etiquette guide for our household.  He was fairly receptive when I showed it to him and discussed the various parts of it, along with my motivations.  

I thought I would share it here - maybe others can build from it.  And I'd love feedback on how to make it better.

Obviously, there is no one-size-fits-all strategy.  A younger child would likely need something more cautious, and an older child would likely deserve more independence and privacy.  Plus, a list of rules is no substitute for ongoing discussion and relationship.  My intent with this is that I'm trying to err on the slightly cautious side without keeping him trapped in the dark ages.  

Here's what I developed:  

**FAMILY RULES FOR INTERNET ETIQUETTE**



**When and Where I Can Use the Internet:**


* I will only use electronic devices like cell phones, iPods, iPads, Kindles, and computers when and where I am allowed to.  I understand that use of these devices is a privilege that comes with responsibilities.  
* I understand that use of electronic devices in my bedroom is more limited than it is in other parts of the house.  In my room, I am allowed to: read eBooks; listen to music via specific apps (iTunes, Spotify, Pandora)
* I understand that at bedtime, my electronics usage is limited to reading eBooks.  
* I promise to limit my online and screen time so that it doesn’t interfere with sleep, chores, school, family time, or other activities.


**Being a Good Online Citizen:**


* I will be respectful to myself and others. I won’t bully and won’t tolerate bullying by others.
* I will be a good online friend and be supportive of my friends and others who might be in trouble or in need of help.
* I will respect other people’s privacy and be courteous when posting photos or other content about them.
* I will help my parents and other adults understand how to have fun and learn things online and teach them things about the Internet, computers and other technology.
* I will respect other people’s digital property and space. I won’t steal, hack, break into anyone else’s accounts or use other’s content without permission.
* I will be thoughtful in my use of copy, paste and forwarding. If I use anyone else’s content or images I will quote them, give them credit and link to them if appropriate.
* I will help create a culture of respect and tolerance at my school and among my peers.
* If I wouldn’t say something to another person’s face, I won’t text it or post it online.


**Internet Security:**

* I will never open emails from people they do not know in person.  I especially will not click on links or open attachments from people I do not know.  
* I will not give out personal information such as my name, age, address, telephone number, parents’ work address/telephone number, or the name or location of my school without my parents’ permission.
* I will not give out my internet passwords to anyone (even my best friends) other than my parents.
* I will not download or install software or anything on my devices before checking with my parents.
* Because information on my devices can be stolen, I will never take pictures of myself that I wouldn’t want everyone—classmates,  teachers,  family, strangers—to see.


**Internet Friendships:**

* I will not respond to any messages that are mean or in any way make me feel uncomfortable.
* I will tell my parents right away if I come across any information that makes me feel uncomfortable or if someone starts communicating in a sexually explicit manner (words or pictures). 
* I understand that my parents must approve who I communicate with on email, chat, text, video chat, and on social networks.  I understand my parents must approve who I “friend” or “follow” on social media.  I understand that, in general, my parents will limit my communication to friends and family I actually know in person.  
* I understand that anything that gets posted online will always be out there and can NEVER be completely deleted.  I understand that my parents must approve any pictures or videos before I post or share.  
* I promise never to meet in person with anyone I first “met” on the internet. If someone asks to meet me, I will tell my parents right away.  I realize that people on the internet may not be who they say they are.
* I will never respond to mean or rude texts, messages, or e-mails. I will simply delete unwanted messages.  I realize that I may need to disconnect from friends who continuously bother me or post things that are not appropriate.
* I understand that my parents will control my privacy settings on social networking sites.  I will not make any changes to these settings myself.  


**Appropriate Content:**

* I understand that there is a lot of content on the internet that is designed for adults and not for children.  I promise not to seek out content that is not appropriate for someone my age.  If I do come upon information that is not appropriate for my age, I will let my parents know.
* 


**Openness About Internet Usage:**

* I understand that it is my parents’ job to supervise and monitor what I am doing on the internet.  I promise I will not try to cover up or hide my online activities from my parents.  
* I promise not to create any online accounts without the permission of my parents.  
* I promise to let my parents see my online accounts whenever they request.  


**MultiPlayer Gameplay:**

* I understand that all the rules above apply equally to playing multiplayer games as they do to other types of internet usage.  
* I understand that my parents must review and approve multiplayer games and servers before I am allowed to play them.  I understand that my parents may need to do research and talk to each other before making a decision about a new game or server.  
* I understand that my parents will need to review what kinds of messaging,  filters, whitelists, and moderation are in place before they make a decision about whether I can play a particular game or join a particular server.  


**Parent Promises:**

* My parents promise not overreact if I tell them about a problem I am having on the internet.  Instead, my parents promise to work together to try to solve the problem and prevent it from happening again.
* My parents promise get to know the services and web sites I use.  If my parents don’t understand the services/sites, they will ask me to show and explain the services/sites to them. 



**Rule Changes:**

* My parents can make changes to the rules at any time.
* I can ask for the rules to be changed over time.  My parents understand that it makes sense to adapt the rules as I get older and more mature, and as my interests change over time.  When I ask my parents to change the rules, I understand that they will need to think about it and talk to each other before changing the rules.

Parenting,school technology,dn9ki6,"Daughter (7) has really crappy, negative, internet raised friends and its slowly hurting her self esteem.","When we moved to a neighborhood from an apartment we were so excited our daughter could make friends who were more likely to stick around. Well the friends have stuck around but they are a disappointment. All my daughter wanted was to have good friends who love to play. Every kid is obsessed with technology. None of them have a unique personality either. Its some internet persona from tik tok or youtubers they idol. They have absolutely no imagination. Mean and negative constantly calling everything and everyone ugly and and stupid. Always screaming. They hit bit and push on occasion. Trashing her room and my house no matter how much i try they just dont pick up unless i say something, then they do it. Im sick of having to tell them. The few sleepovers weve done they say theyre bored, miss their phones, and leave. Theyve even said yes lets have a sleepover tonight!! She gets so excited! And then they change their minds ""just cause"". So im done with sleepovers so she can stop getting her heart broken. She has a very sensitive heart and needs a meaningful connection that somehow these kids dont seem to need? To make matters worse, we switched schools and the vibe here is completely different, not in a good way.

These arent assumptions of them either. I have these kids over 24/7 and have gotten to know them each personally. I was basically a free babysitter this summer feeding them and attempting to teach them to be better people. But it isnt getting better and my daughter is starting to think everyone hates her. Shes frustrated and lonely. She feels used. Its almost like they only play because they are bored. Not because they like her. But she is the type to do anything just to have a friend. I am also home all the time so we spend so much time together. Not as much anymore obviously, shes very bored without a friend her age with us nowdays. I just want to see her happy but im not sure if i should let her cut it off herself with a bit more convincing on my part. Or if i should be the barrier between her and them, no choice, and basically tell them why. 
The kids are ages 6 7 7 9 10. 
Im fed up with internet raising kids. It makes me sick. Im lucky to have a daughter who somehow doesn't like it that much. But its been a struggle finding someone like her."
